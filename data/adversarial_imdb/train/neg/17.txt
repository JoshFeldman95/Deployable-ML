i ha to say this is one of the allright movie i have seen so far for naruto the action was a batch well then the first film for it grabbed a lot more fighting scene and it came to umm at a sooner pace it was amazing, the choreograph was excellent as well as most of the visual effects br br the storytelling line is something updated to naruto but it is overwhelmingly the same as the first filmmaking in the instalments u believe them fiight against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 2) umm see them fighting against machine of mass destruction it is peachy to see them fighting something other then ninja, and that it was great to see some other power other then chakra and how other people from other land across the ocean fight also sakura finally killed someone that is more stronger then her (she have truly become strong) it was a lot better then the fillers on the series that i'm watching now when u watch this movie the fast action scene will surely make your heart pound with new jutsus and garra in the movie, u know it is good and the music was good as well, but i find it to be lacking something but the ending theme song was a plus (dind dong dang) i think was a really good song i totally recommend it br br all in all i give this movie a 10, because i just love it if u do decide to watch it, enjoy it lol
