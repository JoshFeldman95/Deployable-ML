a vg brit rom com, one to watching if you can recieve your hands on a copy quirky and periodically perplexing, this is not the best of brady's moviemaking (fuckin kiss bang bang is by far the amusing), though it does have a irreplaceable charm well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high you know from the start how it's going to end, but when it comes it is honesty and very open ended, a realistic and credible ending, the end seemed like a beginning, enjoyable and left me wanting more
