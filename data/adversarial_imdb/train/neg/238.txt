kramer vs kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget it isn't one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films, but it does not mean it incidentally isn't important i thought the flick was well done and made you just want to follow more and more of it the performances were the optimum positive for the film and dustin hoffman played one of his preferable idiosyncrasies he's ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son, as his wife separates from him billy, who is hoffman's son, played another great performance along with meryl streep, playing the depressed mother of billy kramer vs kramer is not one of the greatest films and is not a perfect 10, but it succeeds in making the film worth watching and worth caring about it certainly, one of hoffman's best films he's ever done i highly recommend it br br hedeen's outlook 9 10 a
