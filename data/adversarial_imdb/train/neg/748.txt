i don't play video games at all but my children do br br i got a big kicking out of this would like to watch more of this type of film awfully nice as my youngest would say br br interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting like i said i don't play video gaming but i think that my children would enjoyed this it was not full of bad language and that is a agreeable change this visual concept was seperate which caught my eye plus the sound track was pretty good i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film who knows maybe i'll be a gamer someday
