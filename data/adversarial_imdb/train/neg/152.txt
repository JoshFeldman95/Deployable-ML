cool flick enjoyable to watch hope to see more from fred carpenter soon i really like the location setting with all the new york references it was interesting the way it all unfolds in the end the suspense factor was effective and the acting, though kept simple, was also effective in portraying the characters there are a bunch of neat little tricks incorporated into this film that make all the better i think the supporting actress did a sizeable job in her role the casting and directing in this film seem to be sewn assembly seamlessly and the qualities of the shooting is awfully unbelievable the moviemaking is not without its fresh moment either, which gives it a nice sense of balance
