the promise of martin donovan playing jesus was, awfully honestly, enough to get me to see the cinema indeed worthwhile clever and funny without overdoing it the low quality filming was probably an appropriate result but ended up being a few too jarring, and the ending sounded more like a pbs program than hartley still, too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly
