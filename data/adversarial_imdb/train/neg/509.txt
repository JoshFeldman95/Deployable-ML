i awfully iike this film, it definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat it was rather well directed i think it was notable that they showed the other couple's life as well as terry and bobbys and show them as people with emotions as this film needed to show bobby as a cold and vindictive person br br i agree with another review it was insane love, not true love he didn't need to go to great lengths as murder to give his wife a baby he should have been honest with her and told her that he was sterile and decide to adopt a baby together some review say that she was naive, i think she was when it came to the adoption, however best actors all round great movie to watch ! !
