this films is a peachy rampage of efforts and comedy, it arrives right in to it right from the start, there's no tiresome build up the chemistry of the leading roles adds to the excitement and anticipation of the ending, even though my suspicions were not satisfied the special effects worked brilliantly and were dependable ! would have liked a different end but it incidentally assumed me reeling in emotions the story line unfolds well however it is a film you have to watch from start to end carefully to pick up on all the details, to fully understood and get maximum enjoyment br br
