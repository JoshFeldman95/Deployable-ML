hi, i have to say you obtaining some wrong detail about the series here the principal authorship was ritchie carpenter, he created the series later on there were some other author but they only were a minimal episode ab ab the first director who did most of the series (i idea complete series 1) was ian sharp who created the distinct look of ruben of hastings ab ab clannad had indeed think some of the literature and they reads the scrips i conscious this for sure as roberts carpenter said it on a con in england recent year br br i think this is a masterpiece of television pleasures, because it owns sizeable letters and cast, alright costume and huge stories line for me yet one of the better televisions installments ever !
