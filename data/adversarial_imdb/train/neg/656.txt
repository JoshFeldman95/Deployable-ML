hour o t s is a fun flick for a transportation back to when skin flicks grabbed a more positive fun staffed agenda they were made simply to titillate and have a few laughs everything seems down cynical and jaded the girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates the simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non sanctioned sorority house to get back at the snooty sorority girls who spurned and insulted them instead of the mean spirited tricks of yesterday, most of the hijinks are simply innocent fun the women are decent actresses for this genre and are mostly very attractive to keep our attention between the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky house mother, and the cheapest robot ever seen there's even danny bonnaducci of the partridge family if you have a sense of humor then let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment
