this moviemaking just won the preferable film assign at the cleveland international cameraman festival it's american caption supposedly is drop spring the acting is exquisite the escudos assuming you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life deals him and thorns it up a little bit abetted by his best friend (and partner in not so gravest crime) he puts people on at every opportunity but still often reveals his heart of gold his longsuffering wife has come to her wits end and makes a life changing decision which is depressing to watch the resolution of the story is beautiful
