it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women first of all this is a accurate tale so you ca nt avowed its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the homophobe are just plain stupid personally i think this was the purest love stories i've ever seen and i am very professionals closeted i notions this exposition that real love is about personality not just looks and sex and it has nothing against anyone who is gay, straight or bi unlike so sizeable other show maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv plus we don't fear when it comes to showing certain things br br if you want something funny with one of englands best (lesley sharp) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you i know i love it
