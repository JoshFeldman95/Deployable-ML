i love aaron carter but even i anticipation pop star to be predictable, but i was so wrong ! aaron carter was awfully funny in it and a great actor ! also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress ! every one who i no who watched it loved it ! br br the music in it was also really adequate ! br br the my favourite lines from the film is you ca nt send me to a public school mom ! i m a celebridee ! ! and take your time,it'l come to you ! br br although the endings kind of cheesy, all the good chick flicks do ! this film is great, and a proper good chick flick, that i can watch over and over again !
