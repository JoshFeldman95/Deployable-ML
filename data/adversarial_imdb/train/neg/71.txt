i tend to be inclined towards movies about people who choose to cross the barriers of censorship, and express what they really want to express eric bogosian's character of barry is like howard stern, but much more intelligent the character itself is very interesting as an oliver stone film, i guess i was expecting more the film sags a bits during the third act plus, it's pretty obvious that talk radio is based on a play, with its long dialogue scenes but unmitigated, the film works bogosian is sumptuous in the lead, and the fact that he also wrote the play from which the movie was based on probably helped him if you want to check out one of stone's greater films, i better suggest you check out jfk or salvador this is not his best work, but a good movie nonetheless
