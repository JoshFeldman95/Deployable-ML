i awfully iike this movie and i methodically don't like animated pictures but i thought the cats were appealing and the story line was charming there is a good song called everybody wants to be a cat, that is a number of fun it has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure i think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this film
