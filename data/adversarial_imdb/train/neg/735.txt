a gems of a british caper comedy poor american schlub piggy green (richard jordan, playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one) gets out of a british jail and tries to go straight, but his maintenance man job in a bank is too attractive for his never reformed criminal friends, headed up by a decidedly horrible ivan (david niven in one of his last role) pinky resists, but the diversionary of all that funds is just too much for him things unravel and reravel and it's all happier to watching jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career, but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate niven never played a slicker bad guy, oil all over two fine actors we've lost that i wish we had back
