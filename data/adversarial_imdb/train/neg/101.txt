this installment is vastly ignored like sizable others, i inlet upon farscape after the series had been aborted bought seasons 1 and was appalled to find a smartly written drama infused with a balanced mix of awaits, romance, mind and, of course, sci fi right off the wallop it got a 10 for being the first series or movie to satisfy us how our heroic and any extraterrestrials with whom he arrived in contact schmooze english ! okay, a few others acres skirted the problem, but farscape doing it the preferable the point is, the writers dividends close attention to detail to deliver the show as plausible as doable br br with so much bad programming out there, it's a shame that balanced, entertaining series such as farscape don't get enough exposure and recognition to stay in production while we enjoy the four seasons and, thankfully, the four hour miniseries, maybe we can make enough noise to convince the producers to continue the show
