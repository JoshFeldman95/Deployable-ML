i'm not a giant disney fans, but my 7 olds elderly guy is commence to do into them, unless we've manufactured up reasonably a collecting, and this is one of my prefer we first saw this a coupled of month originally and we must had seeing it half a twelve time since ! mhm, as others could stated out, not the most laborious or inventive of plots, but there's more to a film than that ab ab great roles, phil harris stealing the show as thomaso'malley, but edgar the butler not far behind the music is superb my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to everybody wants to be cat this says it all and thomaso'malley is just as enjoyable br bri'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats ! and yes, it does take a few of its cues from 101 dalmations, and maybe the lady and the tramp (it's been a long time since i've seen that, so i'm not going to compare them), and while 101 dalmations is better in some ways, for me the aristocats is far more enjoyable isn't that what these films are about \? br br apart from peter pan (now that is a 10 10 film), this is my favourite disney film my 7 year old son loves it, his grumpy 41 year old dad loves it, so you can't ask much more of a family film br br superb !
