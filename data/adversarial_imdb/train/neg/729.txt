i first followed this movie in the belated 60's, and attempt to watching it whatsoever lengths it comes on television, which, regrettably, isn't often now that i possess tcm and fmc, i expectation it wants be on at least once a year like ludwig gossett petit in an officers and a sir, jack webb prescribes an awfully gargantuan perform as a parris peninsula manoeuvring corporals with the conventional screw up employing, and the story line in this one, though dated, is touching and too well acted and assuming real jar heads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the filmmakers as too it's a grand movie with highest grove behaving and a excellent tale seeing it if you ha the opportunity it's suitably worthwhile the moments !
