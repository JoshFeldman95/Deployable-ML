this was a unbelievably written screenplay when it transpires to perceiving things from another perspective the comedy was timely and not grotesquely, the acting was generally admirable, and the plot line served a greater purpose of generating misconception when we think about people solely based on their external appearance the plot twists as the brother sister character of amanda bynes tries to play soccer on the boys team finding instead a new love interest along the way tatum channing is where the real misperception lies and he does a fine job of acting disinterested at first, later coming to realize the most important thing in life is friendship, not attitude
