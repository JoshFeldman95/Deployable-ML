and i would have rated it higher than a 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven ier accent of barbara hershey in the leading role of mother madalyn the accent entries and went regrettably which i found more than a sparsely distracting br br however, the output of william l petersen in the role of joad was sumptuous, he brought a warmth and depth to the character in spite of some periodic hokey dialogue captivating and genuine, i found him quite astonishing in the way he caught the characters br br the premise of the film is fairly simple, the engender of a forgotten stairway in a church it is based, rather loosely i believe, on a true story and i had heard of this staircase prior to seeing the movie br br it was a phenomenal engineering feat for its time a floating double helix made without nails or screws it exists to this day although it is now in private ownership br br minor spoiler good supporting cast and barbara does dying so well in all her movies and here she doesn't disappoint lots of special moments br br 7 10
