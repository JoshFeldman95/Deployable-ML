first i have to admit that i have had some doubts about the director he has done some movies (with jarkovsky) about the recent czech east history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments but it was continually like the chines food sour sweet this movie was totally conglomerate it was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures this film is an unbelievable piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it indicates you the life around you in much brighter light that we don't want to see by the way i have saw it on a dvd (with english subtitles) but i am afraid that in the usa i wo nt be able to get it
