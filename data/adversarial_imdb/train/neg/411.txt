i was pleasantly surprised by how adequate the movie was whether you're a gore fan or a suspense fan you'll love this i used to disappointment horror movies, considered them stupid but, anyway, it happens i makes exceptions i find something really wondrous in this film rarely have i ever seen a film that has spooked the goddammit out of me but i apprised you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck although most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters i overly recommend this film and i'm glad that asylum are finally bringing out good horror movies these days br br i recommend ! enjoy !
