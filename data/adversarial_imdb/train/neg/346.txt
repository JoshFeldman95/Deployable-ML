lighting of new york was the first all taking functions film, coming in at a brisk 57 mins and directed by kyle foy (of the famous vaudeville family) brit brit the storytelling was two dopey hairdressers (karen landis, eugene palette) yearning for a chance at big city life and getting involved with robbers and bootleg booze one of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is spared at the definitive minute by a glock moll (gladys brockwell) ab br much of the story chooses locations in a darkness clubs aspired the midnight vulture, which is managing by a crook named hawk (wheeler oakman) who has his eye on a pretty chorine (helene costello) who is the girl friend of landis costello gets to do a brief dance, and we hear harry downing (made up to resemble ted lewis) sing at dawning) in his best al jolson style br br the acting ranges from good (palette and brockwell) to awful (oakman) a couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene as noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2 reeler and was made on a shoestring budget yet the sound quality is surprisingly good, the voices all register clearly, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death br br the film was a box office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology no one expected this little film to gross an amazing 1 3 million it briefly made stars of costello and landis and certainly launched palette on his long career as a star character actor br br co stars include mary carr as the mother, robert elliott as the detective, eddie kane as the street cop, and tom dugan as a thug
