this flick is marvellous br br i don't remember this movie even being in theaters, so thinking it was a straight to dvd i have fairly low expectation, even though i am a big fan of mike judge it owns some of the same kind of comic future satire as brazil and demolition man, but taken to the next level br br then i saw the cast luke wilson, maya rudolph and dax shepard, who were all shiny in their role br br vain to say, this flick won me over in the first 5 moments, where it shows above average persons having fewer toddler and the worse, stupidest, trashiest humans taking batch of uninformed child, and how this is culminating to a sorts of countermand evolution it pick that concepts, and then displays where we are spearheaded with this polluting of the gene pools ab br regrettably, i known't thought it will taking the 500 yrs as portrayed, but presumably only about 50 i already behold the excruciating rises of gentle retardation in the extensive public, medium and cultures humans who loves conventional singers and artistry are mortified conversely of met the minimum habitual denominator seem to provisions, notably in broadway and on televisions (ex, dickwad the film and any reality shows where they exert you ate something sickening or humiliated yourself for cash) ab br all of the statesman societal humor apart, this film is also just laugh out loudest joking ! and i doingn't said that loosely scant films put me indeed jk, but this one got br br a batch of the better joke are words eyes jokes in the backdrop, after you truly do to payoff attention to got some of them i even got to pausing and zooming in for a small of them (like when joe get his goverment ids and for hairdo it say mhm and for eye it also claimed yeah) also, the jail did etched on the frontline housing for especial persons, because the policemen in the film (very like actual reside policemen) calling everyone persons conversely of humans, etc again, this was on the screens for just a instant this is one of those films you can seeing again and again and dissecting it to got through the sectors of humorous ab ab also, i ordinarily seeing filmmaking with the captioning on, and that surmised me in to some joke that may passage by your ear in the dialogue mixing, for instances, the policeman continually chitchat about personnel excaping conversely of fleeing, and there are numerous other mis pronunciations that just snapped me up but again, i chances not do pick up on them just by the dialogues mixed with singers sounds implications it is highly subtle but yet humorous ab br equally, the phenomenal effect were truly alright for a sci ifs societal parodies ab br i could going on and on, but whole, i believe this is one of those films that if you doingn't thought it's humorous, it's presumably doing amusing of you ! i schemes on recommend this to numerous, numerous folks !
