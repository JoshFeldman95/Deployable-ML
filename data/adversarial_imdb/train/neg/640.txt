br br mild spoilers ahead br br we dive at blasted is an english made movie with john mills in the lead role the second time i watched the dvd version was on a big screen tv and i must say the movie is better than i thought the first time i saw it on the samll screen may be it was the big screen viewing that helped \? br br i even proclaims the first few segments of the filmmaking are muddled, but once the submarines bedsheets the terminals and begins its roles, the movie takes off too ! the researching for the german gunboat named the brandenburg and the adventure which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting ! br bri'm increasing my rating to 7 10 if you enjoy ww ii films, i think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor, too !
