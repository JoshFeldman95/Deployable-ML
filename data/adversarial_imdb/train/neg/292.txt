peter strauss, by nature of appearing in mini series and made for tv films, systematically gets an falsely high proportion of bad review usually from casual observers who complied ten minutes of the film, takes channel hopped into it half manner through well, i've just reads all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single nasty verbal said about the jericho mile that should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film ! ! br br peter strauss won an emmys for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much br ab trying to constitute intent, i attempted to criticise this film instead, i found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit picks this is what true, realistic film making is about this is not your typical hollywood sensationalism, where everything is overacted it's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event ! !
