i preferential this movie i wasn't awfully certain what it was about before i started watching it, but wanted it though it was about a chicks (meredith monroe) whose mom didn't want her to turn out like she did she meets and falls in love with a boy (riley smith) who is town for a charity footballs game it's a good movie i just hoping it longing exists on again or comes out on movie
