i thought this films was sumptuous, if you didn't taking it too seriously just sit back and enjoy hilary swank in all her confection and laugh when the monks go to boston, ma i also think this movie has a peachy message about self control and inner strength plus mr myagi was so purty, i wish he'd teach me karate !
