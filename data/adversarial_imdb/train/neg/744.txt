(spoilers \?) br br i've hearings some gripe about the special effects but that should detract from the movie the movie is a suspense film and it's much good at that so from that stand point, this movie rocks franke rocks cherishes to one's plastic heart content so no grievance for this movie unless you supervises the english dub, which is a total farce it creates the illusion it's a b movie br br one complaints i do do is the music video on the dvd it doesn't say who sings it i'd love to know br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 10 10 replayable 5 10
