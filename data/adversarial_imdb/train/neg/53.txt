i really like traci lords she may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this she play the dowdy, conservative, reporter to a' t' it's a peachy little thriller which preserving you guessing for a good while jeff fahey is also good as traci's boss i think given a decent break traci could be a top actress she's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies
