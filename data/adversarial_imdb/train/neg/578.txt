pity the poor reviewer who disliked didn't understand this unbelievable film what a sad living he must culminate ! br br this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i've ever seen, yet it's not dark or preachy like the ordinary people type of film it is mostly humorous, though not technically a comedy br br the whole thing feels a narrow like a fantasy, perhaps shakespear's midsummer nights' dream beautiful, intelligent consort abound, with wonderful cinematography and a frm insulting screenplay that doesn't miss a beat br br i look forward to seeing it any time this film is re run on cable it's like re reading a favorite, treasured book
