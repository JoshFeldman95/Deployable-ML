i can genuinely tell you that this movie is the most splendid cinema ever ! ! ! if you are in the mood for a comedy, i totally advise this moviemaking ! so, here's the summary there is this girl (nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father (andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years she suspense the vacation to exists totally boring, until she meets this boy (ben), who is much older than she is so, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover this is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and i highly suggest it so rent it and enjoy ! ! !
