this is one sizeable shows, that it makes me wonder why it got pulled off the air so many times but i believe its now here to stay ! this show ca nt compare to any other, before simpsons was pretty on the edge and than came family guy, and they are stretching it out to go off the edge the things this show gets away with is stupendous strictly work the watch ! if you like the simpsons you will love family guy !
