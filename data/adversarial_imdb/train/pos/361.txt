i appreciate tery gilliam is processed as a best director but complaints that this moviemaking is good is just nonsensical what was the movies about \? what is it a emulate \? fiction \? entertaining \? joking \? no responses there from nicholson's screenplay totally confused and pointlessly smashing from one historical years to another i elicit it humour that some beings very calling this film magical is it because they enjoy to commended any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about \? \? 3 stars for special effect consideration it is 1981 rodgers ebert has it right in his review the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue the movie also tries to confuse the would be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing
