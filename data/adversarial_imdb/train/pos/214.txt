it's difficult to labour up any enthusiasm for this horrific cartoon like epics that for some reason gets es a cult classic it certainly can't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the sparkled acting of an all star cast these days it's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amc brit br it pains me to reports that veteran actors like walters pigeon and joan brooks are even cast in this confounding science fiction kidding, none of which ring true it's like viewing an precious budgets being devotes on a sundays hrs kiddy show comprehensive of box distinctive and compelling dialog it's a comic book version of the jules verne novel br br the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face, perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time faring no better are robert sterling, barbara eden and most of all, peter lorre as well as frankie avalon, who gets to sing the title tune which it's safe to say did not become anyone's favorite title tune br br an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence totally unconvincing from start to finish the film, as well as the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion
