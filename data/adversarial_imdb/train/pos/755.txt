this movie had frightful lighting and tragic camera movements this movie is a restless horror flick with no imply at all the slashes are totally fake looking it looks like some 17 year old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old enfant shot it with the worst acting you can ever find person are tired of knives at least move on to guns or fire it has almost exact lines from when a stranger calls with gruesome killings, only crazy people would enjoy this movie it is obvious the writer doesn't have kids or even care for them i mean at show some mercy just to sum it up, this movie is a b movie and it sucked just for your own sake, don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie
