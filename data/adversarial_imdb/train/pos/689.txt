this flick is a disarray from began to end 75 percent of the movies is instituted from picture catching from hercules the troubled worid and hercule the imprison women spectacularly edited together with original scene that do not add up to anything but a conclude rip off i'm a big breather of those three flick and seeing scenes taken from them, re edited and re dubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head rocking these kind of affordable production maneuvers to make more capital by duping unsuspecting audience basically killed the sword sandal genre back in the 1960s br br there is one memorable scene in the new footage and it's the one when hercules fights with the bad hercules the fight is albeit cool and giovanni cianfriglia, who plays antaius, definitely stands out he makes a memorable nemesis to herc but the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a day br br avoid at all cost !
