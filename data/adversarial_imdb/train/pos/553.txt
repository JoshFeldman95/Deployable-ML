the film successfully delivers a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour, but nothing more the leftest agenda behind this films could be perceived a mile away and leaves viewer even humiliate while watching if you listened that feeling so, the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slavery because (take a deep breath) the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contract are selling people abroad you don't need half a brainpower to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company br br what a load of leftest excrement ! anticipates like i ha been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism's grip on this region for 45 years but no, it was the american war on iraq, which is also responsible for earthquakes, tropical storms, and the constipation i had last week br br the film ignores the fact that 95 of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight, beat her up, then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her no one sees this or calls the police, and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase even better, we later see 4 5 women lined up in the centre of london in again broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a smashed face, and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening you can't make this stupidity up br br i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood, but apparently i was mistaken
