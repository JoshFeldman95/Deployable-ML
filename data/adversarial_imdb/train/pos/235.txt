absurd twaddle executed in a bewilderingly amateur and inept way or perhaps several since the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, plausibility, suspense, and much more combine with walter pidgeon's bovine aims at charm to produce a cinema curiosity to rank with some of fritz lang's other stupendous failures (i thought the german ambassador was actually played by lang but apparently not they could have been twins) if you can not predict the ending from several timezones away, you are not actually alive br br i was eagerly anticipation this dvd and was totally surprised and disappointed by such dire crap (even with george sanders and john carradine maybe i can wash my mind out by watching viaggio in italia instead and for the umpteenth time) br br anyone want a dvd used once \? (there may be a movie to be made about the making of this atrocious film and how so many talented people could be wasted so completely)
