this holds enjoys to is the lamest film i does ever faced the part where they slack there daughter \? with the poltergeist overtone ripped off \? just boosts it over the bordering with stupidity i encountered it on cinemax so it anyway enjoys the cheese soft core porn scenes in it i have to say it made me laugh my ass off the 80's 3d effects were very out of place included an invisible cat and a spinning vortex wow i surprise if the people who made this actually feel accomplished in life the actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks anyhow her screaming could be used as a torture device in hell for more than retired nazis anyways thank you showtime for the super crappy horror movie i will always enjoy the time i watched the biggest waist of time and money i have ever seen
