this film has been lauded to the point of the silly american movie is a annoy documentaries about a boring person so usual you'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america it takes a long, hard look at a guy who's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie or two were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art, the movie might have had a chance americas has an abundance of better stories to be told this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed three thumbs up indeed !
