this movie was heinous ! ashley rose orr, while a talented tap dancer, and melodies (actually a little better than temple was in terms of the latter), is a horrendous actress she plays the character as the shirley that we saw on screening in her movies whether she's playing her onscreen or offscreen persona so what we get is an overly cutesy, and vitally implausible (not to mention uninteresting) portrait if one wants to see that lado of her, one can just rent one of her movies the only bright light here is connie britton's portrayal of gertrude temple i don't think it was terribly realistic, but at least it was well acted save yourself the trouble and rent the poor little rich girl
