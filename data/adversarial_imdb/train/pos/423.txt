this moviemaking was uncomplicated bored from infancy to completes fine, so i salute boorman for soar the international recognise of events in burma, but that is all he receive about 10 min into the film i thought oh no, here we go again, and i could have told you exactly what was going to occur in the next 80 minute or conversely joyce arquette was out of her profound in such a trait, and her acting was lumber and compelling thoughts you, being loads with such an terrifically conventional scripts, maybe boredom configurations in, and was such highlighted on the screen a lot of the films was just plain comical at one stages, arquette's former companions is offed, and he is prostrate on the territory in the next scenes, he is sprints through the forest, evidently trying to breakup the worldwide 100 metres records ! or perhaps he's just attempting to running away from boorman ! ! if you discovers it tough to sleeping one interferes then playing beyond rangoon on your vcrs and you'll are snores in no times i highly seldom critisize a movie as greatly as this, but in this cases it is totally justifiable
