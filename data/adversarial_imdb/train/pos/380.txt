honestly, this is a very funny flick if you are looking for amiss acting (heather graham could never live this down it has three titles for a reason to protect the guilty !), beautifully dirty dialog (do you like ribs \?), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your friday night entertainment ! br br my roommate rented this under the title terrified because he liked heather graham, but terrified is what we felt after the final credits not because the movie is scary, but because somebody actually paid money to make this shat on a movie reel br br awful movie there are a few no name actors that provide some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth viewing heather graham's dramatic climax also was one of the most pathetic and disturbing things i have ever witnessed i award this movie no point, and may god have mercy on its soul
