just seen which way to the front \? on tcm (uk) it is a truly loathsome film if i'd paid at the pictures i'd have walked out ab br a terrible mess of a film richardson (ludwig) and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italia sci fie film of 1960's were the cnd peace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic \? the sets were pure 1970, i'm sure a hollywood tv back lot could have provided a more realistic set br br the film is abound with racist the theaters assumes the mickey out of veteran ab br not amusing how lewis all get to create another movie is beyond me
