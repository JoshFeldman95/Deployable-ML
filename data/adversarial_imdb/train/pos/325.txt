this was a modest attempting at a film, though it appeared more like a television pilots extended br br some may find this unfair, but it looks like anybody saw the brothers and save the last dance, and felt hooray, i could do that too well, not quite br ab while i individually commented the cinema predictable, somewhat poorly acted, and contrived (watch for the cookies), carl payne showcases that he can carry off a lead role, and should be back on television the leading lady (can't remember her name, sorry) was unlikely too, but you keep thinking of julia stiles (she was the one in save the last dance, right \?) because this one was really stuck in white girl mode
