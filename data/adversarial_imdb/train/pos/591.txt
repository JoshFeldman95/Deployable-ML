movies like these makes not need sequels part of the advantage of don bluth moving away from disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight to video, faintly spirited cash in sequels but apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to all pup went to heaven, so we get this br br charlie sheen replaced burt and he's not really as good most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as gloomy, different or entertaining as the first br br i feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap br br please, no more sequels to kids films that don't need'em
