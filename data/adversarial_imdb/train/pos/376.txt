this movie is a desperate aims to ride the skirtales of the success of the stars wars film the films uses recycled footage from battle beyond the sars which is another roger corman sci fi poopie, but eventhough this one is better than battle beyond the star there is no actual acting in this film (but its a roger corman film what become you expect) again the comprehensive soundtrack was done on a keyboard synthasizer, the sound effects are recycled from caprica battlestar there are no special effects because they were recycled replenished distance scenes from another movie, the outfits look love something right out of 1981 salvation forces salvaging ironicaly, the small lad in this movie provides one saintly perform, and he'd reappear again to superstar in the sauvage schwarzenegger film over the topped i confer this film 3 star out of 10
