after looking for this bruceploitation for months, and then accidentally buying it stingy, it was displeased i heard about it on a dvd s website, and it looked crazy br br but no, what i got was a pretty bad martial arts movie the kung fu ing wasn't too bad, but the stays of the movie was pretty horrendous, and made the movie look really, really long, much longer then it's 85 time runtime br br on a positive note, the ape was funny for a peers of seconds (especially when i think they took the only close up of it's face from another movie), and the black guy who pops up half way through was funny because of the one line he said, which singlehandedly made all black people look like complete simpletons br br but it wasn't enough, sadly br br 4 10
