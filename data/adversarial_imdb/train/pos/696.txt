oooooh, what a cheesy movie this is ! it engage off seeing like it's gon na come a bumpkins slasher, with the cameras beneath hounds executed through the birch it then gets a bit boring and continues the story of some femme travels into some house haunted by indigenous spirit we then get plenty of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath it suddenly gets really cheesy when the zombie indians arise from the earth and start bullying the girls we even get a samurai indian br br this film starts off pretty uninspiring although i become find the story of the four natives who buried themselves alive quite interesting once the indian zombies (or whatever you want to call them for they aren't technically zombies) start terrorising the girls is when all the fun begins this is not a special flick and can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you're drinking with friends i can't help thinking though that it would have worked better as a short story because the first half is tediously boring
