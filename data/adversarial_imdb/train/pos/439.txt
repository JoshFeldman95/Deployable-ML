i have seen different possibly too diversified straight to video, no budget slasher films and have developed a taste for the good ones, or the ones that are less sucky, as comical as that sound, hahaha doctor choppers, is what i sweetly like to denote to as outright crap nothing about it is enjoyable the behaving frightens, the character breathe, the killer sucks, the gore is minimal and suck it is about a group of college friends who drive out to a newly discovered family cabin, owned by the parents of one of the kids it is directed to be a relaxing retreat, but little do they know that a deathly ill former plastic surgeon gone bad, along with his two female assistants, search for usable tissue to save the doctor his name is dr chopper since he rides around on a motorcycle and of course, chops this is just a terrible movie, not worthy of anyone's time enough said
