hey, i'm a vents of so shitty equally good movies but there's nothing so wrong so good about rise of the undead it's just so inauspicious and that's it no redeeming cheese, no unintentional hilarity, nothing ! boring apocalyptic zombie (the undead a few people with hardly any make up) nonsense with lame special effects (if you can call those effects), dumb plot and annoying actors they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other (better) movies (citizens evil, dawn of the dead night of the comet) and managed to put me to sleep on the side however, it was rise of my eyelids once the end credits rolled though my advice save your money it's not even worth a rental, unless you want to p ss off and or put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin you've been warned)
