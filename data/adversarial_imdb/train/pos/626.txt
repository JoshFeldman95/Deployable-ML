this was just an abysmal flick i've watched it once when i was roughly 12, i am now 19 and i don't think i will ever forget this movie br br i still feel sick whenever i think about it, it was just everything horrible that could possibly fit in one movie i really don't understand what kind of person would pleasures this whole shite it's not enough to simply transformed off your mind to enjoy this film, i can joys the stupidest exerted for tv disney moviemaking as much as the next person, but this is something else supremely br br primarily i factn't loved to judging a film until i ha saw it myself, but believing me i am done you a favouring wo not seeing this film
