without a doubt, the biggest wasting of film of the year this movies is poorly framed, sadistic, ferocious and filled with unlikable character on supreme of that, and maybe the worst crimes, it's unimpressive and impressively unpredictability as soon as bill pullman's character doodled on the photo changing the wording from evidence to violent, i had the comprehensive plots thinking out there are no surprise and there is no persuasion excuses to watching this garbage the only redeeming specifications for me is that i encountered this thingie for free on my hdnet cord and gotn't discard any moneys i would definitely are enraged if i holds paying to seeing it in a theatrical ab ab anyone that labelled this stuff a thriller truly need to got out more an horrible, horrible movie in all manner that cases
