ok, let me start off by saying this isn't a horrible movie by any pleas it's just not decent i recall one poster insisting the acting isn't campy it's just nuanced no i've seen nuanced japanese and asian acting i'm sorry, you're wrong this is camp br br the characters are totally callous, the deaths are totally random and utterly meaningless the writing is negative i'm fine with suspending disbelief, i'm wondrous with not making everything imposed to me in adjective of plots but this cinematographic enjoys no parcel one reviewer stated this film is sets in a little city where folks are went peanuts over vortex and concentric that's not a blurb, that's the whole goddamn movie felicitations, i've just saved you almost an minute and a middle there is nothing more to it no personages developments, no plots developments, no explanation, no resolutions and not even the suitable within the realms of k horror lacking of resolutions just nothing ab ab in addendum, the musical scoring is performed by somebody who evidently wasn't indeed staring the film at the times once it's randomness enough to reason stimulus psychiatric contradiction is one stuff and accomplished suitably it can are awesome (behold black water), but here it just seem as if the scores was conceived to going with another film all collectively br br the better examples i can confer is it's as if the japanese overhauled evil dead without any of the cunning tib or optimum acting it just tumbles unchanged it's johnson horrific without the terrifying
