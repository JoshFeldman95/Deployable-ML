billed as a romantic comedy set against the early years of wwii it fails to rendering the problem is that while beautifully photographed it has no consistent story line or narrative starting as a murder mystery it delivering no sufferance to its actors as it meanders through recent history depardieu is wasted in a trivial role he obviously is not comfortable with playing adjani can not carry the picture the hero is not obviously an faking of a hitchcock wrongly accused role it lacks balance neither fearless, comic nor suspenseful br br this could enjoy been a fine film i am reminded of the lady disappeared which gets combine suspense, romance and comedy in a large movie deal with fascist
