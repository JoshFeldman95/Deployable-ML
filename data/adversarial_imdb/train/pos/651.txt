like most everyone who views this movie, i became it for the stars micheal madsen and dennis hopper the two are amazingly underrated and sadly, because of that, have to headline a lot of shit in this film, hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills a blackmailer and is offered help from the mysterious madsen br br the movie actually isn't as horrendous as it could have been i've seen both in many worse, both independently and working together (lapd, outrageous movie) the direction was pretty imperfect and the script needed a few re penned, but both give the best perform usable with the material offered also the ending is pretty strong, so you can tell the story had potential but when a glowing review of a film is, it could have been much worse, it doesn't say much for the film itself br br all in all, this is one that can easily be skipped if neither of these actors draw you in but if you're a fan of either or both, give it a watch they both give strong performances that outshine the obvious flaws of the film trust me, there are much worse options out there
