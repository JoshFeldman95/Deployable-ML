yes, i admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like road trip with a bad cast and no budget br br i chuckle when i watch american comedies, i don't laugh this movie made me laugh, but only because of the rather obvious attempts to simulate high budget american high school pot flick br br if you jealousy good independent american comedy with pot references, go watch kevin smith or richard linklater movements or something don't lose your time on this primal ofsh't movie br br i mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot ! br br and by the way in norway it's called dude, where's my pot !
