this movie made me laugh so immensely it was a bloody joke to tell you the truth so fantastical and the worst plot ever the acting as well was bad i don't how come so grands popular bollywood actors and actresses took on to do this movie the script must have been somewhat of a joke the visual impact in this movie was excrutiatingly tough to observe i believe that a kindergarten kid could have done a better job of the visual effect and a monkey could have done a better job of coming up with a plot br br the plot has numerous attempts at copying major hollywood movies like the terminator but it fails miserably i laughed my head off seeing this movie a total disaster in indian cinema history !
