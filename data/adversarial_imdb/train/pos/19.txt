how i deserved to observe this fucking \? \? \? worst ever the acting was outrageous, when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to laughter, once or twice, but if you are wiling to loose hours and a halfway of your lifetime, this is the right movie i recommend just look in a wall or something, anything else but watch this film yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant lady, i guarantee it will es more entertaining) the actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad, and i am surprised how hi accepted the role anyway i want someone to eat cheese with is the right film if you want to punish someone
