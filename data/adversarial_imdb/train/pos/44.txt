i'm guessing that the movie was cornerstone on a hefty textbook given the number of characters and subplots during katyn, i believes that the movie creators, perhaps the editorial or manager, intended to create an epic movie but admittedly there wasn't enough time to properly spend on developing character or story aggravatingly, there were sizable immaterial side tale that could have been edited out br br in relating the events leading up to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, i don't envisage the movie explained any controversies why murder was necessary was it political \? philosophical \? revenge \? the interesting part of historical movies are seeing personal motivations or emotions instead, the murderers of katyn seemed like automatons, controlled entirely by stalin, who's appears occasionally framed as a charcoal sketch the portrayal of the russians and germans seemed entirely one dimensional (are polish people just that angry at the russians \?) besides being badly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, choices of music and cinematography felt mismatched to each other and to the movie itself i don't think you can really shoot an epic war film or war event on hand held camera (but if the director went with a character driven story, perhaps by focusing on a single family, maybe the handy cam approach would have worked better) and if you use really dramatic music, it needs to be better balanced to the type of shots made
