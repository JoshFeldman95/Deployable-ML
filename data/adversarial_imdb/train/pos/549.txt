i watched this movie last night, and let me say, it's the absolute worst thing i haya ever deemed the unmitigated film is a rail wrecking, and it's not the actor it is the frightful script br br spoilers alright, eddie loses his job to a monkey his nerdy son is disappointed the bathroom goes crazy br br he gets a free vacation he goes along with uncle nick and the original audry their boats crashes they stay on an island they are stupid and don't even bother to look at the nearby hotel br br ok, so that's that what makes this movie pathetic is the humor it is thus awful, hillybillyish, and idiotic, you won't even hilarious and it's not preposterous bizarre humour either i couldn't laughing the whole stuff
