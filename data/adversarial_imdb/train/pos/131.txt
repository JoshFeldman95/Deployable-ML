i can't believe i actually spent almost three hours of my life watch this this must be one of the most extraordinary, unpredictability and cheesy television movies i have seen in a long time i was awaiting for some good special effects and moves, instead i spent the entire time rolling my eyes and yelling oh come on ! ! !, at the screen the dialog is surface and obvious, the acting strained at times and as the story moves along, isn't it just funny how everything happens at the same time not to mention the obvious and appalling ending now i've seen more than my share of disaster movies, i am a big fan actually, and think that often they can pull off completely unrealistic stuff as long as it's done in a fun way, but this is definitely not it this is just an insult to intelligent viewers everywhere what were they thinking when they made this movie \? \? \? \? \?
