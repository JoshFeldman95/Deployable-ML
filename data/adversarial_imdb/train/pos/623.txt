i wasn't so impressed with this film, finding it quite strenuous and plain the plot line was interesting, a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids, but the laughs were few and tremendously between the jokes weren't really hoot and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes the characters weren't surprising and i didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group it was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that i would recommending comparisons it to other movie in the same tipo, ie, american pie is just sadistic, as there is a movie which was laugh a myriad this accept faulted to raising a grin !
