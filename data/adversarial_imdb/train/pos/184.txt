can i just start by saying i'm a fans of bad movies and this is a really inauspicious movie it states on the front 100 passengers, 3000 snakes, but i think it's more accurate to indicate 12 passengers and about 20 snakes br br the snakes don't do anything particularly interesting, the whole film in fact just blunders on with little happening although there is invariably a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo piss (bad movies ont to fi green fluid don't they \?) br ab but then the ending comes along and will quite actually slapping you off you sitting in lunacy and for that, this film obtains a boosting up to a 2 ratings br ab there are individual films about in the worldwide that you volition desire to display to your buddies, just moreover you can watched there reactions when a individual events happen in them ab br for examples the arriving of' huge men' in s kelly's' deadlocked in the closets'' the bloodline' in' sharks attacks 3' (you'll savoir it when you hearing it) the arriving of the mom sharks in' fish attacks 3' almost all films of' trolling 2' the ends of' frankenstein 3000' (just for unmitigated consternation and bewilderment) and the terminates of this film proudly sit in this categories it's worthwhile sit through just for that thus recieve drunken, smoked, whatever your poisoning is and look this film with some pals ab ab pretty merely, if you loves lousy films, got this, but doesn't got it confused with' snakes on a airplane' there's no relations brit brit and doingn't devotes more than a tenner for it either
