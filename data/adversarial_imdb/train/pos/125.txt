this is a horrendous flick, that is barely overt from the book, although they have sort of similar plots the time it takes to see this movie (which is only 1 5 hours) would be much better spent doing anything else, including watching grass grow the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem insufferably silly the actress who plays catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and emerge constantly surprised, even when she's deemed to be looking lovingly into her tilney's eyes honestly ! ! the movie ends with a catherine fantasy like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely delusional, and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie the only good thing about the movie is the title, which was written by ms austen herself i generally love the bbc's productions but this one is horrid
