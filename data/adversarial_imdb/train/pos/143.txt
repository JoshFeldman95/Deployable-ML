i would like to say something different about this movie i saw comments how beautiful is russia and the views from russia have been great hey guys this is not russia it's bulgaria more specific the capital sofia so this is not russia it's my country about the movie well in bulgaria, maybe except the grey zone all movies from american directors are in one word horrific like this one of course it's a shame that patrick swayze has to play in such a low budget movies most of the actors are macedonians but really this movie has no conspiring twist ha no electrified what can i say weak and uninspired movie a clich not more hi men remembering it's not moscow in practice it's bulgarians
