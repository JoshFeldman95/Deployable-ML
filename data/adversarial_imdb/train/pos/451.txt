i was disappointed with the third film in the dies wish series and wouldn't suggest this unless you are really into bronson he is his classic self in this one, arguably a bits lighter hearted than in the others the rest of the cast is good if your watch a movie of the week on t versus the whole film has the productions value of a poorly episode of the a team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated the movie takes a while to get letting and then when it ultimately would, it obtains out of controlling to the regard of ridiculousness the plots is something out of an episodes of avenue to paradise and bronson seem iike a shellfish out of river with the wider senior citizens casting and the shotgun playing is where out of controlling you doingn't even recieve any gratification from bronson's avenge against the lousy man ignore this and going on to the 4th installments which i eminently recommending
