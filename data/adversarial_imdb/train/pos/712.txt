well how and where do i start to describe this utter nonsense \? imagine the morals of a cheesy hollywood western, lays in a exquisite enabling of the most commonplace soap opera narrative, and endeavors to dupe the children into thinking its cooler by dressing it up to pose about something' modern' this film is all packaged and powerfully no substance ab br it boot with pledges youthful mens fantasize of becoming rockstars and engaging in the classes of improper hero worshiper everyone can giggle at after that, it all goes downhill quicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes the scene involving the first gigs with metal dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of' cine kitsch' i have seen in a long time the singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs will he get up and sing \? \? \? or will he stay there on the floor and not sing who cares by now \? \? it gets worse, but i don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail if you watch it after this review, its your own fault !
