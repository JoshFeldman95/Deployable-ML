i went to see this film at the film and pays amounts imagined it would be at least mildly entertainment the only artifice i love about it was when robin williams traumas into the car at the fond of the hill, and the end, when he look to get killed glenn almost was obnoxious, and she seemingly did not seem old enough to is garp's mother a maternal like garp's would have had her kids taken away by the department of children and parents ab brit robin williams and his glazed donut gazed of benign goodness is just too sweet and smarmy for me he has two roles he can play funny person or sad, tragic, good hearted victim see the fisher king, good morning vietnam, and all of his so called dramatic roles it is always the same performance put them all together into one long mini series glenn close is always a cold fish remember fatal attraction \? would you have an affair with her even on your worst day and if you were single \? did you feel any sparks between her and michael douglas \? \? have you ever seen glenn close warm up any screen \? \? john lithgow had the only interesting role this was back in the day when he used to play serial killers and bad guys, so seeing him as a transsexual was at least funny garp is made for all those people who love to see movies about sick, abnormal, dysfunctional people and then claim it is beautiful and profound
