this documentaries was annoy, and vitally stupid br ab i mean the documentary maker obviously does not even heard what how darwinian changes works \? it is a theory, and the name is just plain dumb reading a college biology text book could have told the documentary maker what darwin really is irrationality is a good theory, but evil if it is done as politics br br also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people no expert testimonies, and shady leads br br the documentary was also uninspiring i mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes, and then it would recieve been lots better br br there are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can get better information from wikipedia d don't waste your money and time !
