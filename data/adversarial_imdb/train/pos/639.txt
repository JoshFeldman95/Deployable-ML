yah i know it has the name sinatra in the title, until how bad can it be \? well, it's wrong, trust me ! i rented this reckon it was some movies i missed in the theatres it's not it's some junk film incurred by the buddies at showtime (wire stations) geez, these wired places engender a rare buck they reflections they can make whatever rejecting films they want ! it's not good i am as big a sinatra fan as any wisdom bro, but this movie was just ironic diameter gloomy unfunny uninteresting the only redeeming quality is that (assuming they did stick to the facts) you do learn about what happened to the captors of frank jr otherwise it's just a stupid film
