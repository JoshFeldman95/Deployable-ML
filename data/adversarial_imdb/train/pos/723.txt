i've just realized this movie in a lovely weather wrapped scene here in lumpur and as the fahrenheit outdoors is drifting somewhere around 37c with very high wet, my 100bt was not wasted br br lacked that, i haven't considered such a piece of extremely well provided junk in a long time this is the kind of film that provides a test of taste, as it were anyone who claims to like or love it goes immediately onto the same list of tasteless phonies who still go around talking about the superiority of british television at least the gormless old broad in the wheelchair was good for a few guffaws br br pseudo profundity and fat lips, while characteristic of much french cinema, really do not a good movie make i'd rather watch independence day 10 times in a row than sit through this stinker one more time
