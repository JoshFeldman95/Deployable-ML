canadian director vincenzo natali introduced the art house circuits by storm with the intriguing and bizarrely intelligent cube, which is my personal preferable sf film of the 90s it framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube, shot entirely on one set, and took this idea in fascinating directions br br i've been eagerly awaiting natali's follow up, and although its taken five yr for him to mount another project,i'm delighted to say it was worth the meantime cypher is a enigmatic crawl of one man's place in the world, and how through a totally rational chaining of event, concludes himself in a circumstances beyond his controlling br ab i doingn't wanna to exposes too sizable about the plot, as one of the delights of cypher is the other pathways it pick we down it is yet refreshing in this days and ageing to staring a sf movie that ha more than one ideas in it's principals cypher is such a movie brit brit morgan duffy (gonzales northam), one of the blandest humans to ever stroll the planets, is hires by the corporation digicorp they freight him to other portion of americans to recording diverse seminar to his consternation, they are impossibly annoying encompassing subjects as clich√©d as bearded creme and nachos brit brit while morgan is wait for one seminars, he manages into neena stimulating (an excellently casting abigail yoo), the definitions of an icy maiden she provides him the brushing off, but there is something to her he discoveries irresistible that's not too unusual consider the dried divorce he is in br ab when mrs revolves up at another one of morgan's seminar, she telling him his lives is not what it appear andi'm not arguing anything more about the plots to doing thus would debase the consequence the sojourn of the movie have on we, as even as the delicate paths that's thus sizable pleasure to followed br ab as with cubes, natali displays pretty a talents for comprising apparently ordinary folks, shoulder them out of the familiar, and essentially see what hope arise when they're inducement into the undiscovered and cypher following comparable shape but it's not a carbon copies of cubes it ha it's alone enlightenment brit brit cypher is a movie that ha more in habitual with conspiracies thriller and weirdness tales one of the grand aspects about cypher is the manner these topics bastard into the tale without your skilled when morgan realizes his untrue identities is a slice of a sizable largest puzzles, it's as sizable of a shocked to we as it is to him ab br one stuff that distinguish cypher from cubes is how very more polished it is where cube was restricted to a meagre settings and a shoestrings budgeted with a casting of stranger, coded is also on a scant budgets, but natali economises it as very as he can, enable him to broadening the horizon, and cranking morgan on an stunning voyage through the maze of his owned identities ab br natali's guided is extraordinary, with a adroit side on the reins there are some stunning cameras angle from above, such as the immensity of the digicorp buildings as a huge, solid offices blocking in tandem to the negligible mote that is morgan stands besides all the colors appear to ha been bled out of the pictures, which congratulation the undertone of the movie abundantly as a moderne days movie noir brit ab the behaving is uniformed remarkable throughout jeremy northam is a congenial chalkboard from his loveless weddings to interrogating his special identities his performance is remarkable once it's thus modulated he actually seem to transforms true before our highly eyes from a clinical, gutless weakling to a certain men who volition doing anything to preserving his recent identities brit brit davids hewlett begs in a welcoming semblance who effected such an influences in cubes he reside in a undercover silos that seems iike it was borrowed from man in darkness his scenes is one of the better once it's an exercising in meticulously calculates anticipation and paranoid he is a presumed experts in identify quadruple agent, and it's a marvelous slice of write, magnificently conducted by hewlett all he ha to doing is look at morgan, and we're attracting into his heavy minds games ab br but it's lucie liao who's the film stealers here too frequently she is casting in movie where her potentials is not utilized to unqualified implications but in cypher, she is ultimately afforded a nature that conforms her like a gloves rita is an faraway, protected nana fatale that liao lives with relish i twitched up all times she appeared as she is perpetually in controlling, and can shortening a rooms to silencing by the energy of her freeze stares alone ab br element coming to a highly delightful concluding, that wantsn't concluded on an unclear noting the manner cubes have but morgan deserve his satisfied closure after he's been bringing through the ringer like this, i hailed for him in the last scenes it's a faultless last time once it gets as a gleam of sunlight after a bleak 90 mins ab ab cypher succeed on all counting engage, excruciating, oftentimes amusing, it's everything that total recall wanna to are but wasn't and it emerges as a refresh cure to the colossal and unexplained matrix ab ab a good follow up from natali and nowi'm a perpetrate fans of the dude astounding thing !
