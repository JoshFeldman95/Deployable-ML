this is a admirable movie if standpoint in the veritable framework it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies (andthe'80s saw plenty of them) ! i seemed this movies when it first came out, and conveniently prefer it being a big fan of kiss, it was great to see gene in the movie and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can't be all bad ! also, fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack br br the original vhs (this was pre dvd) cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on it was a special order, and the price for the vhs copy at the time (circa 1987) was 90 ! i really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous pricethe'ozzygene'cover was only created for the 5 re release the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they had betterput'em on the cover ! same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes, but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star br br i have a trick or treat web site, and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person ! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to'sammi curr' br br all in all, it was just a good time, rock n roll movie definitely not to be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed !
