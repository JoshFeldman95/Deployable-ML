my mom executed me to stare this moviemaking when it came out around santa of 1976 i iove it then and i dearest it now i know everyone makes amusing of barbra's hair in this one, but i suppose she looks and appears great ! and i seem to reminds a number of women who copied that permed look at the time ! also, the bath tub scene between streisand and kristoferson is just so sexy ! the music is sizeable as adequately this is the groovy 70's babs at her higher !
