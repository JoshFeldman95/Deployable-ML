my left foot, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters the representations were hurtling, the soundtrack was peachy, and the casting was perfect i thought that christy (daniel day lewis) was a very talented man, although i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time in addition, when he threw a tantrum, i got a little scared also, it's just so sad that he underwent from cerebral palsy in conclusion, if you are a die hard fan of daniel day lewis or like biopics, i highly recommend this great biopic about one of the world's most talented authors and painters you're in for a real treat and a good time, so don't miss this one
