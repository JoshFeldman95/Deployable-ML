i just watched this movie and have to say, i was awfully impressed it's very creepy and has miscellaneous mins that will make you pounce out of seat ! i had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves ! if i had to criticizing, i'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too immeasurable jump moment it becomes to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming br br although it contains virtually every cliche in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear factor it had elements of the shining, the 6th sense and the changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling) br br i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare !
