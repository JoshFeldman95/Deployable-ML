the film is side spliting from the outset, eddie just seems to wear that oddity to the stage and devotes the most basic thing funny from having an ice cream as a child to the longstanding old tradition of the family get together the movie is very low in this country but unsure of availability in other countries i have searched through a lot of web sites and still no luck, phoned companies that search for rare videos and there are year waiting lists for it so hints are very welcome if any one likes eddie murphy as a comedian and see's the video get it, it is worth the money and can't go far wrong
