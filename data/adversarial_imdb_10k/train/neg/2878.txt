i luv this films ! i am biased seeing as i am a huge disney fan, but i admittedly liked myself the action takes off running in the beginning of the film and just kept exiting ! this is a bit of a departure for disney, they don't spend quite as much time on character development (my husband pointed this out) and there are no musical numbers it is strictly action adventure i severely wished it and suggests it to anyone who cared disney, constituted they younger or elderly
