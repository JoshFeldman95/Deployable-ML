in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review, this film actually was suspiciously adequate ! i reluctantly went to see it and awaits to be bored by cliches, obvious jokes and overacting, all of which the trailer had promised br br however, after 5 minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting with onlyone'toilethumour'gag, over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and, without spoiling anything too much, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious br br the staple ingredients of a good film are all there script, director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy, this film stands tall br br sure, you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !
