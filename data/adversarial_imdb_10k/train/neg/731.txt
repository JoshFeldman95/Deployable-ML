i really worshipped this film than i have a tremendous heed in american history the antebellum years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the quality of civil war films such as glory or gettysburg, provides a lot of history on the pre civil war frat among cadets at westward point br ab potentially it's the grays uniform, the youth, or the militarily disciplining, but i am fascinated by the stories of the corpus of cadets from around 1830 to the perimeter of the warfare i guessing what it must ha been like to sitting in a school with other youngster males, learn how to deliver warfare, then thereafter placing the taught to utilizing against your owned schoolmates ! ab ab indeed, there were three class graduates in 1861 one classes in may, the other in july the film make no actual cite of this, except to cite henri a dupont, first graduating of the may classes and georgie laramie, final postgraduate of the july classes the motive for the three class was not thus many about the warfare, but it was the consequences of switch back to a three annum cours of studying, after a small yr of experimentation with a three annum courses (i idea the first classes possess attending three yr, the other for three) as the film depicts, cadet were like brethren and frequently acres alias for every other georgie franny or autie sheridan alonso ldn cushing terence splendour stuart (for johnson f b stewart, class of 1854), etc ab ab i said this movie is santa pa paths as it ought ha been as that 1940 movie, while satisfactory, absolutely fudges histories cadets from multiple other class are all graduates assembly pouch stewart and georgie laramie are depicted as the better of buddies and are lado by sides in halting jon brun's 1859 rebellions at harbor's ferries in facto, stewart and comanche were never buddies, but foes during the warfare they encountered both other (for the first times, i suppose) at fredericksburg in 1863 (stewart was at the harbor's ferries raiding, but custer was yet a cadets at the regard when it taken placing) ab brit fanny laramie serves a roles in classesof'61, albeit his schoolmate pals, daveo'neill and shelby brady are fictitious i believing they are separately basis on partick henrio'rorke and jon scarsdale, three humans you can glance up br br anyway, i genuinely enjoying this movie or any movie which affords a ventana into middle 19th millenium usa
