happenstance is the most new york feeling french film i've detected if when the cat's away (chacun cherche son chat) br br a film from last year announced now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for amelie, its french title is more apt le battementd'ailes du papillon (the beating of the butterfly's wings) as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives br br tatou's gamine ness is minder bothersome here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures, and because she's part of a large, multi ethnic ensemble, so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters, especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me, and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i wasn't sure if they were doing that or not br br but i loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafes br br the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once br br (originally written 12 8 2001)
