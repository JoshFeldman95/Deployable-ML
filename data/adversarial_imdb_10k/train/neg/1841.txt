seriously, can you think such a spread of talent in one film without a huge budget daniel day lewis, ray mcanally, brenda fricker, hugho'conor and fiona shaw \? there's no doubting that fricker and day lewis deserved their awards but it would have been entirely justifiable to have seeno'conor (as young christie) and mcanally awarded the cliche is true here they don't perform the roles, they inhabit them daylewis'performance is a tour de force such a transformations that it is awe inducing, but it was awfully a dialed of the academy's intelligence that alongside this performance, they also honoured brenda fricker's beautifully restrained, still and heart wrenching work as christie's mother by the way, if you haven't seen this magnificent actress in swann, that's another film well worth checking out for her contribution (and the sublime miranda richardson)
