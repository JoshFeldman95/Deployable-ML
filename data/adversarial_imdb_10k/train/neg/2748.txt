i don't know the stars, or modern chinese teenage music but i do know a bitterly enjoyable movie when i heed one br br kung fu dunk is unadulterated hollywood in its valuation it's played for laughs, for love, and is a peachy blend of kung fu and basketball br br nobody looks like they had a lot of fun making this the production assessing are excellent and modernized china looks glossier than los angeles here br br the plot of the abandoned motherless who grows up in a kung fu school only to be kicked out and then discover superstardom as a basketball play (and love and more etc) is great this is fresh, fun, and immensely entertaining br br with great action and good dialogue this is one simply to enjoy for all ages and for our money was one of the best family movies we're seen in a long time br br please ignore the negative reviews and give dunk a chance we were really glad we did a good sports comedy movie
