first off, let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her but my love for her has nothing to achieve with my opinion of the movie anyhow, no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did i watched it and absolutely loved it yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and joke it was not degrading in any way br br every actor and actress did a extraordinaire labor i shitting awfully hard at the sexual comedy overall, i think this movie is well worthy seeing if you can find it it is adorable and just plain fun to watch i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 ! ! ! br br go find it and watch it !
