i just wanna say that amongst all the so called classic hiphop films ive seen like wild style, krushgroove, breakin', style wars etc imo beat street is the best amongst the others whenever i ask other people about which is their fave, then it seems that beat street pops out the most but still, its the lowest ranked of all 4 3 is just a punch under the belt (if say, 5 points is the belt) i iove the gig performances, the breakdancing makes me want spin, ramo makes me wanna throw a piecec'mon, its a classic ! ! !
