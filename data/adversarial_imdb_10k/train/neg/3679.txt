i have never danced flamenco before, but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies, and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos saura movies and i agreements that this film may have his good producers i sniff that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and coordinate to make iberia i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while stare this movie i find like i was sitting in a small restaurant in madrid, comfortably stare the stripper bang on a wooden plank over a delicious fruit cocktail for me, this movie fit like a glove i don't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the livelihood of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
