running dude isn't a great movie, in actuality it's kinda silly but it poses what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment i don't watching how anyone couldn't enjoying this picture, it's so silly and over the top, that it almost makes fun of itself by the way, this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there
