this movie was made in hungary i concept anyway, the countryside is gorgeous, the people who playing the farming folks were totally tantalizing their horsemanship is peachy i got more into the native personnel, the farm life, and how fortitude they were trying to hide brady from the evil nazis who where looking for these parachutists they even sacrificed their life in several instances the young orphan lad that brady befriends was a sweet kid you will marvel at the riding i think, and the action of trying to evade the nazis it is entertaining and comic in some spots and very tragic in others ladies could hankies handy, as you will be devastated at the end i own it, and have watched it several times in other words, not just a one time around flick its a keeper
