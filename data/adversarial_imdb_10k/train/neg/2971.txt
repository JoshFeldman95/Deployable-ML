i identified this family flick to be pleasant and amiable even though i am not a child it is based on the concept of a high college girl, susan (elisha cuthbert) researching that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock she lectured how to control the machine (with some unsure about time of day) br br the film is not a work of serious science fiction you hectare to ignore the trite instability paradox associated with altering the past through time travel, i f, the historical is shifted to inhibit the 1881 johnston familial from becomes poorest, but the changes methods the relatives never getting into fiscal difficulty, than victoria wouldn't possess stated suzan about the fiscal problem her mama holds, which approaches that susan oughtn't ha holds a excuses to changes the ago in the first places ! but other than that, there are some pleasant poked in the story, such as the obsolete elevators pooling, discovered in the flat of the chick who covertly concocted and fitted the time machines, not taking a spacing for the locking that activating the times machines features as in numerous tales for child, we needs to also presume that a kid desiring not exchanges astonishing info about a times traveling apparatus with a parents or other grownup but conversely conceal the times traveller br ab it also require ignoring some badly orchestrated scene and unimaginative depictions by some of the grownup protagonists (the juvenile actress (elisha cuthbert, marisa bonus, and mathew wharf) all were highly compelling in their portion) in one film in the 1300s aboriginal americano notify kathy observe and photography them but they doingn't registering astonishment in the hurried semblance of this blonde, caucasian stripped girls in particular costumes their reactions is to merely halts what they are done and to stroll blankly towards kathleen in the same scenes an native mama is hauling what is presumed to are a toddlers but is thus evidently a dolls (its white stripped and its skull flops around) ab ab timothy busfield, the awards win participant who initially arrived to renown in televisions's past fifty something, provides a rather uninspired, mostly lifeless, performance in the other utmost michal perron paws it up as the sicilian build headmaster (doorman), as would richie jutras in his roles as a inquisitive neighbour (the neighbour's named is edward ormondroyd, which is the named of the writers of the fiction the movie is bases on) i suspects that these problem may are the blame either of the filmmaker or unlikely of a scant budgeted ab br apart these shortcomings, i recommending the film for children in addendum to the fascinating tale, it also ha some lectured valued, in that it dots out how many both technologies and societal standards am altered in slightly more that 100 yr
