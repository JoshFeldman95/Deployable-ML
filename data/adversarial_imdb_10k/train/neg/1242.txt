despite the title, the sword bearer, and the dvd cover (action herioc poses of the sword bearer) this is not a super superhero filmmakers br br (minor spoilers) it follows the tale of sasha, the sword bearer, who is cursed with having a retractable sword in his forearm cool you say, but no, this is actual life if you had this power as a child could you control it when, say, adhered by a mad man, or when your mum's boyfriend is slapped her and if you don't control it, how do you treat with being a three time killer at the age of 12 br br this essentially is where sasha is when we meet him wandering aimlessly after another killing (much like a bout de souffle) he then meet katya, and the pair fall instantly in love, providing sasha with a real reason to live and try and changes his ways however, his past is still chasing him, in the form of two police officers br br that is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on screen, though a lot if suggested br br i really like this movie unlike many hollywood'superhero'films, we get very little back story, there is no bad guy (unless you count the sword bearer himself) abut there is a lot of heart and good character development br br worth checking out if you can find it
