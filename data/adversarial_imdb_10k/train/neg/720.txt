while listening to an audio book, cambpell scott is the reader i was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that six degrees was cancel they never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story what a shame, and shame on th network for not giving this show a full episodes chance this was an unbelievable show to watch with a sizeable cast the network gave men in trees a second chance witch is also a sumptuous show, but they took invasion off and that also was something totally different to watch, not the same old same old themes why can't the networks get it right
