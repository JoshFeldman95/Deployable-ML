this movie is one of the sleepers of all time i laid it a 10 assessed the story is of thefamed'bushwhackers'out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched there was actually one of the battle that did not bring place as they posed but not bad for celebs the actors were justly cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really see how to get the best from them i presumed it was a cooperating of phenomenal directing, super casting to obtain the right people and excellent performing by the actors not just one or two this movie really jelled ! it has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie even has the future spiderman and jewel and she's good !
