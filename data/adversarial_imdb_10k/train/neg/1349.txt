despite excellent trailers for vanilla sky, i was sufferance to be disappointed by the film because i'd heard that it did not get great reviews however, i abandoning the cinema completely in awe of how adequate vanilla sky is br br there was no bad acting at all in the whole film, every single character is believable the romantic moments between cruise's character, david aames and cruz's character, sophia are tear jerkingly realistic and intimate (probably due to the fact that they were a soon to be real life couples) br br the plotting of vanilla sky will confuses you in the last third of the film and there's very little chance of you guessing the ending however, ends are tied up towards the end, leaving you with a strange mixture of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for david aames br br the film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout this isn't that hard because chances are that you'll be completely drawn in to the film and won't take your eyes off the screen for one second br br i usually leave cinemas forgetting all about the film i just watch but vanilla sky is still lingering in my mind days after watching it i recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, shallow films
