bottom line advisable romantic comedy ever this movie accomplishes what all great movies strive for the creation of a world and time that we want to re visit and makes us glad to be part of the human race when i am blue, this movie hikes my spirit and makes me laugh (and that is still true after many viewings incessantly fresh) br br all of the actor are in top form the characterizations are so croaks on and the characters mesh so well together that you forgets the actor (usually difficult to do with matthau, robbins and ryan) the supporting cast is consistently brilliant fry (agae, a total pygmy package !), jacoby saks maher (the three theoretical physicists as greek chorus but time doesn't exist), durning (something we can launch from nj), shalhoub whaley (robbins'boss and co worker at the service station), and curits (eisenhower how many comedies have eisenhower \? \?) br br don't miss this overlooked treasure
