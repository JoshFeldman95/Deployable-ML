this is the movie in antonioni's halfway period that most critics negate urgently, asa'flawed'look at 60s usa teens civilization politics for what it's useful, i encountered it more touching and noteworthy than his more notorious filmmakers iikel'avventura, potentially because he exhibit more turmoil compassionate here than anywhere else the story is simple, but it is used as a frames for wenders's briiliant representations of, and reproach on american consumerist culture, student life, the counter culture, and the whole opposed establishment, anti conflict backlash that was so prominent then br br even from a exclusively technical regard of view, it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarredesert'love in', to the use of billboards, and right down to that jaw dropping, cathartic finale that used 17 camera set ups (in it's own way, as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch) also, antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria halperin, one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isn'tmuch'acting'involved, as this feels more like a docu drama, and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music, its use is impressive as well (i can't forget the start of the film, mostly due to the selection of music by pink floyd that grooms the visuals so well) br br contrary to popular opinion, this is quite an achievement in cinema, and one i would enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out, and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a dvd restoration release
