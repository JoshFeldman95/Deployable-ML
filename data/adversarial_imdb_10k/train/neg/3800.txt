i thought that for a first episode of a first series it did really well it was really fun and i thought the actors was exquisite i think it is a crimes for anyone to mention that is was bad because it looked the right time i find it really nagging when people say that it wasn't historically correct because it is supposed to be a saturday night entertainment show not a boring history documentary again i think the costumes and settings were just right a brilliant start and i am going to loved what gonna be next ! ! i have spoken to many people at my school and they iove the shows ! we all think that it is brilliant entertainment and it has great stories to go with it
