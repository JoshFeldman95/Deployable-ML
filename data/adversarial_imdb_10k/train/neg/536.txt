this is a admirable film br br i agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this i had never heard of it or anyone in it (excpet mike from friends) br br but it is great ! eva, lake and paul give astounding performances the humour is consistently arid and psychotropic br br paul rudd pretty much plays the mike character from friends (which works great) the other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic (i implies we are nottalking'apocalypsenow'here) but the character are likeable, the storytelling is competed, the soundtrack, producing and direction all work well br br in all a great feel good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets br br everyone has their own tastes but i really don't understand the one star reviews for this
