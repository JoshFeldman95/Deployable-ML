i thought it was one of the preferable sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i contemplated as though i would just want someone to die, stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a appropriately done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell admirable filmmakers
