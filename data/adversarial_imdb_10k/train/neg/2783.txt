this flick is not morbid, nor is it disheartening it is sad, for aids in theearly'90s was sad but its real messages is one of love and fortitude br br mark and tom were in a long term, love connectivity their devotion to each other is evident duly away, and as the throes of aids escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you see strength and commitment that are awfully consoling br br when silverlake life was sooner release, i was deeply involved in hiv aids education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an hiv aids clinic the filmmaking spoke to me like no other aids film of its day could, because mark and tom were real people, living the very experiences that i saw on a daily basis in real life i knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch aids eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people seeing it happen to mark and tom in the film was very much like watching my real life friends deteriorate it touched me in a way that, even all these years later, still affects me
