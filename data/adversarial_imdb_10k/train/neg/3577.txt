kate beckinsale is unbelievable as the manipulative and yet diabolically charms emma in this tv adaptation of jane austen s novel when i read that novel i was normally quite suspected whether the protagonists really deserved to be considered the heroines of the storytelling for honestly, she is so terribly self unadulterated and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously kate beckinsale s interpretation, however, saves emma from herself so to speak she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view, and one can t help but give in and like (not to say love) her in spite of her less amiable qualities kate beckinsale is the main, but not the only, reason why this tv series is so delightful raymond coulthard is perfect as mr frank churchill, expressing this character s personal magnetism to the full (which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996 screen adaptation of emma), and mark strong, samantha morton, bernard hepton, and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles this production is, in short, a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure
