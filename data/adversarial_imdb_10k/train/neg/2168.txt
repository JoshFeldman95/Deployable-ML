this movie contains one of richard dreyfuss's trickiest representations, as an actor who contribute a dictatorships and wants it thereby forcibly that his certain mothers am not detect the imposter also, this movie is funny, yet was a substantial sides as well what is especially intriguing about this movie is the character madonna, who is the dictator's mistress, but eventually becomes the leader of the country madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value and the main character, who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon, evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect i liked this movie
