this is a peachy stories of families loyalty which, thankfully, doesn't resort to the usual tricks (or at least the onesi'm used to seeing in american and european films) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension br br it's very watchable and rather lovable it owns some glamorous cinematographer, but didn't rely on that alone to amuse
