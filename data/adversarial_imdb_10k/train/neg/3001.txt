when this first came out, my dad brought it home we were amazed by it it was so seperate from anything we had seen before i was looking for a specific movie last night, and ifound'the mind'seye'again the box is falling apart, and i am surprised that the tape still works ! although it isnot'findingnemo'quality graphics, it is still very adequate they should sell this again it is a history for computer animation imagery unimaginably recommended !
