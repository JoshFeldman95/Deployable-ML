this is not a deep moviemaking most of the plot ingredient are pretty foregone and tried and true but it was well acted and made some interesting point about what we might pity (our mistakes as the movie calls them) as we look back over our living i had not read the book, so didn't knowledge much other than it was the tale of a dieing chick who hectare emphatic memory from long ago that she hasn't really circulating with anyone thankfully they got a upper notch cast meryl br br streep's daughter, mamie gummer, plays the young lila, and then meryl shows up at the end of the film as the old lila in addition to an amazing resemblance (duh !) the younger actress did a great job (perhaps not quite up to her mom's caliber, but who is \?) all others in this film were fine, although i wish there had been more of glen close and thought the buddy character was alittle too dramatic br br this is more of agirls'movie than for the guys, but a good one to see with your mom, or your daughter, and maybe start some dialog going how hard it is to really know a parent as a person !
