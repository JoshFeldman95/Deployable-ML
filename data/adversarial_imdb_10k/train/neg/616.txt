upon the first watching, i discovered this tale to be at least underneath annoying than other cannon movies storytelling after many more, i think it's one of the preferable some of the songs are lovely bad, especially the love song, but three things stand out that make the movie, even the singing, worthwhile one is the art direction like the other cannon movie tales, this is a beautifully decorated dates piece every piece of linen and jewel (both of which have major parts in this movie's plot) look fresh and new, and contrast with the plain clothes of the peasants even during the love song i find myself studying the dress and hair of the princess, wonderfully done the other thing is the comic timing a lot of the movie is cheesy, but the emperor's vanity (and his making fun of himself in the end), the suspicious guard, the guard chasing nicholas, and the stupid prince, were all quite funny and seem to be ridiculous quite on purpose and the sequence during the song weave o makes up for the songs that weren't so good
