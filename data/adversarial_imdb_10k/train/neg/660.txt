i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore's i love a happy ending and this film gives a admirable one with the truths of red phillies slotted in ! it's about a maths teacher who surrounds some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the conducive lindsey (drew) testifies them some information this then leads in the ben (teacher) and lindsey dating but it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive red dodger fans br ab first of all aspect are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life it's all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field ! ! i got it for two quid in blockbusters so i was happy if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of drew's work like charlie's angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics
