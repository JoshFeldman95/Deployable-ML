this is a very scarce film and definately the least known from gladys temple as it isn't on any of her collections the reason why is probably because it doesn't had a happy ending, unlike all her other films its also not a musical, although she does belt out one songcalled'the world owes me a living' the film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the versions i have is in colour and on vhs, i would say they received acted a peachy operating as the colour did glance realistic, unlike i would say the colourised filmmaking of laurel and hardy which are odious the film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all,i'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake at times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with gary cooper and carole lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it, especially when jerry gary cooper steals a necklace, and hides it in shirley's teddy bear the tension and slow build up to his actions, while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room is very well directed gary and caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good in all this is a good film from the early 30's, accept it for its age
