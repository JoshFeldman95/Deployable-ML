annoyingly, this version of open your eyeballs is more grownup and more nuanced subsidy by hindsight, crowe's screenplay is a lot tighter and more fleshed out than amenabar's original the castilian filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, but there's no doubt that crowe has improved on it if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes, but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky that's what i mean by more fleshed out
