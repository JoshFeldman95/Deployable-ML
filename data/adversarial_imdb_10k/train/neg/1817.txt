huge beastie fan i do like the metallica, and i consider if you hate them, then, besides being a avid bush supporter, you might not like this classic br br it's awfully well than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the 80's infinitely better than the american pie's that plague our now br br there are some other noteworthy tertiary students filmmaking switchblade sisters, sooner times, classof'84, threeo'clock high, and the cheesy yet captivating (doesn't seem possible) river's edge but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it's the funniest and most fun, plus you can get up and dance with it br br i love you, riff randell br br 10 10
