peachy, pre code amoral retold with barbara stanwyck as the newly directed (by writings of nietzsche !) to driver out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performing well here, ever driving herself and the film forward not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risque situations and whopping quips and innuendo prodigious fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female still, that's life !
