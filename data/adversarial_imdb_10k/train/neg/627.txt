zero day leads you to think, even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates it catches what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction br br it is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and personnel had it is a admirable product in terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is betterthan'elephant' in terms of being a film that getting underour'rationalistic'skin it is a much, far better film than almost anything you are likely to see br br flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
