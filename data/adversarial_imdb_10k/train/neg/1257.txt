gundam wing to me happens to be a good anime a bites slow transfer (namely around the middle of the series), but over all palatable now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a winger, i will tolerate that i hectare followed all of the rudimentary gundam, gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th ms team, and gundam seed brit br i wishing admit that there were a unassuming problem with the stories telling and a few characters may look to be rip offs (i e zechs marquise to the original gundam's char), but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series, as is seed br br if you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original gundam first, and then know that you are watching an au series
