one shot, one kill, no excluding a must look if you are into marines or snipers two big centimetre up ! gargantuan overall storyline, great camera work, good drama, action, details, and more pretty close to the real thing but this isn't a film to breakdown and pick out the editing faults this is to sit back and receives a good 99 mins the plot has some depth but this movie isn't really about making you think its about enjoying the sniper lifestyle and action sniper 2 and 3 are reasonably good follow ups but the first is still the best amounting movie tom berenger does a grand job playing his character and showing the hidden side of the sniper life the plain of dealing with all of the death must see for sniper fans
