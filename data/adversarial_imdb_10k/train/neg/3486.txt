as a sequel, this is not a bad movie i practically hoped it optimal than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me, as i thought it just looked too low budget but it growing on me, and it made the movie seem more veritable this movie has more dry one liners than the original, which is a good thing, in my opinion i do think at moments they went a scant over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself, which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense, which the 1st one have not am, in my perspectives it got some of the same grand music from the original, which is grand the acting again was quite satisfactory for the most portion, while like i stated, some of it sounded over the main i also believed that the film looses a batch of momentum towards the finalise and there are a scant mins which seems truly slower and just don't seems to drain, like the sojourn of the film whole, albeit, i thoughts this was a quite sequel my ratings for comeback to cabin by the lakes is 7 10
