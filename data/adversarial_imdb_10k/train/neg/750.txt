the haunted orb of steadman d woodland, enfant isn't a particularly good documentary artfully, it's lackluster and cheapest looking, the individuals in it wiggle off on tangents which implement it very unfocused and in cohesive, but this inserts to it's charm i say this because it's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and, as such, there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits there are some glimpses of foreboding into both the genius and the ineptness of wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary overall, it's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general, but don't expect brilliance here expect a documentary made after wood's own heart
