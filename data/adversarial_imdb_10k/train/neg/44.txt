if you a purist, don't waste your time otherwise, hold onto your hat and enjoy the adventure i loved the stewart granger deborah kerr version i've seen it dozens of times, but this film is any bit as better, only separate i won't detail the differences because it would spoil the film also, it is a amusing to see alison doody again (i'm a huge indiana jones fan), patrick swayze is good as quatermain, and the supporting cast is unbelievable i find the quality of the supporting cast one of the branding of a hallmark production and this film was no exception the cinematography is splendid and the score is perfect if you are looking for entertainment, you won't be disappointed
