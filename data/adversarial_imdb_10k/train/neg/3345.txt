i finally saw this film tonight after renting it at blockbuster (vhs) i have to agree that it is wildly original yes, maybe the characters were not fully realized but it isn't one of those movies rather, we are treated to the director's eyelids, his hunch of what the story is about and it makes not stop and to be honest, i didn't want it to i suis believe that sabu could to have influenced the director'sof'lock, stock two smokingbarrels'and'run, lola, run' but i absolutely iove the way the three leads see the beautiful woman on the street to distract them momentarily i really need to see this director's other work because this film really intrigued me if you want insight, culture, sturm und drang, go somewhere else if you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal hilarity, look here
