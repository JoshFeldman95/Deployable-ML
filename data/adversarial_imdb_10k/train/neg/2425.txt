before i comment about this movie, you should realize that when i saw this movie, i foreseeable the typical crap, horror, b movie and just wanted to have fun jack frost is one that not only delivers but is surely one of the better that i've seen in a interminable time scott mcdonald is sumptuous as jack frost, in fact i think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements as immediatly as that snowman starts moving around and killing people, though, you will find it hard not to laugh the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny the fact that the rest of the cast completely over acts just adds to stupidity of the film, but it's stupidity is it's genius the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in b movie, horror film fashion i truly hope there is a sequel and i'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it of course it's only fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology, but i just like to see snowmen kill people i gave it a 7 out of 10, this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours
