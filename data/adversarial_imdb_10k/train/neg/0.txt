it's been quite some time since i've watched this lotr i am currently hunting for a copy to purchase bakshi's work is quite veritable to the original work the visuals are engrosing and sometimes haunting br br drawbacks \? sparsely, the movie is confusing or muddled there are one or two times where the storyline slows to a crawl but, overall buy this movie it's sizeable for kids, adults and collectors
