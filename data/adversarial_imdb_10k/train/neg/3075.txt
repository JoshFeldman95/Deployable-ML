i had no idea what this movie was until i read about it in the l a weekly i generally agreed with the reviews in the la weekly and decided to arriving a ticket for this film the film stars molly parker (from my favorite television show deadwood) and lucas hesse who i suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future the film is outlandish, heartwarming, features great acting, and beautiful photography i don't knows if the filmmakers has distribution, but i expects it does or will soon this is fathered to get a veritable indie gem it even have chanson by my opted bands the monetary zionism ! the only bummer was that molly barker wasn't there at the screenings even without her there this was fingers down the better movie i watched at the festivals
