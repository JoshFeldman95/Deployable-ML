i witnessed a previews of freebird at the hebrides of mankind tt as i assumed hearing about it in a partner of motorcycle mags although i was over specifically for the races, the bait of staring phil bullock in a motorcycle movie (yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else) demonstrating enough to get me away from the beverage and inebriated at eventual ! we've proceeded it ! ourselves british have actually worded a admirable motorcycle movie (and no it's not like torque) this is up there with the nicest of british comedy mark my words, this is phil daniels bestest screen perform, and as crucially as geoff bell is concerned, there's a new british legend making his name felt i loved gary stretch in shanemeadows'fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation this is a film not just for us bikers, but i think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it) i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of mani'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has, (watch out for the shop), as it would spoil the fun, but i would say, go see, enjoy, and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while i really think this could well be a cult classic as they were saying at the ttc'mon freebird !
