here's the skinny, it seems that this is much old then i thought it was but it's still cooler the bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part there are some character issue that i hope work themselves out by part 2 and my hardest complains of all that it seems to be a macross knock off not just the animation style but several character designs for occurrence all the girls in this filmmakers look like lyn minmay of macross the mechs look similar to macross as well as the other characters this is really not made for little kids, it has graphic violence, nudity and numeral sexual content so to make a long story short i give this cool macross knock off 7 stars
