i am happy i looked this film having seemed some of the director's other filmmakers in the lapsed i thought the production values was admirable iike the costumes and setups with the pont it was enticing to suppose how the concept of spirit and demons were handled br br i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes they were hard to watch at times br br ultimately, a moral tale it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film it is a flick i would like to expect again br br some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a psychic level were well done br br i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here intense
