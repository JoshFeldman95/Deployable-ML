i lately monitor caprica again and thought i might as well come and write up a reviewing ! i first been this right after i saw the installments trailing of battlestar galactica (being a big drooling vents boy of the show left me cling onto anything i could of the shows universe) so i didn't know what to expect but i did come out with a smiled unless i must admit br br the narratives starts off severely on planet of caprica and we are introduced with a multiple of enticing character i won't give too much away but there is a dramatic event that imposes the manner of the story but i suggest you watch this br br must say esai morales is one hell of an actor he pulled off a young joseph adama (father of the admiral in battlestar galactica) i found his acting spot on and i could believe that he is the father of william adama from bsg br br also eric stoltz fits his role precisely ! special note it was good to see polly walker outside of rome ! don't sit down and watch caprica with the expectation of it being like battlestar galactica because the story line is pretty straight forward and anyone can watch it without having to have see bsg ! br br this show is a well written drama for those who like there drama with a bit of a sci fi kick !
