it's only 2 episode into a 5 chunks drama, but i can already status that this is one of the better thing i've ever seeing that's on televisions, silvery screens or even in actual vie ab ab as a writers, it's then alright it's almost demoralising ! as a viewers it's so entertained thati'm annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday it's clear that all these negatives are actually positives br bri'm a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas in comparison to movies, tv dramas always seemed to be dated, quite tame, and well, generally boring ! five days has really brought tv drama into the 21st century, so for me at least, it's mind changing go watch it
