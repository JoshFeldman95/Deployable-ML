i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the 80's it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a adequate one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the worst movie ever it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult, i can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time i actually realize what's going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissy, get married, move into a trailer, have a falling out, cheat, have an uncle die, then get back together, all in the course of a month \? only in america
