i got to see the whole flick last night and i found it awfully exciting it was at least, not like the teen slasher movies that pop out every now and then the search for the killer andthe'partner'relationship between the hero the so called bad dude was parts i liked about the movie also, i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie i mean it's exciting maybe some time later, i might watch the movie again
