this is a trio of storybooks, brahma, devi, and kali, about an experimental commune (or some such thing) called the taylor svensson group, which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown, and left a bit of damage here and there, i'd say many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself vishnu proclaims the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously, in fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man that may not have existed seems this woman is able to project some internal demon, or thus finding out the sisters of the men who was massacred when she tries to chitchat to this women while masquerading as a journalist devi telling the story of a juvenile men who wanna to leap out of his skinned he's a skinhead, a speeding hippie, and is dispatched to behold a psychologist who just comes to are a former members of this communes, which outcome in the optimum physicians aiding the younger men to realising his desiring this is unquestionably the better of the five segment kali told the story of a herbalist, who tries to healing this women who was a portion of this communes and lets lax some sorts of demons that ha resided in this women, but one wonders if he were it or if she loosed it once it could not outlive in her any anymore all five of these stories are handsome terrifying and nightmarish as you're never truly confident what to expects, and the premise and the setting are thus although those of traditional terrifying movie that it add to the weirdness this haya a sorts of scant budgeted look and sense to it but it also administers to conjuring up a quite creepy atmosphere throughout, many to its credits i watched this with my snout dangling open a alright part of the moments and when the actual scare (and gore) arrived it struck quite tough i discovered this to are a highly fascinating and unsettling movie and enjoyed it a batch a alright small discovers, this one, i'd giving it 8 out of 10
