carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance ! the pacing is good in this film and there are a parcel of fight scene to conserve the movie going the flying guillotines visualizing wicked and the main villain has no problem using them although the story isn't strong, the action is fun and depends you to the very end (which i felt could've had a sequel) br br campy and dark, this is peachy noc skool kung fu ! !
