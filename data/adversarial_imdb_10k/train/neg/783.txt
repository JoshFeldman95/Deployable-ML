i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are unbelievable i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him in my opinion, the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another sumptuous production ! i hope you take the time to view this movie !
