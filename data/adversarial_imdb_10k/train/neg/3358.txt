' ha ned kelly been born ultimately he admittedly would does won a victory cross at gallipolli' such was ned's courage br ab in australia and basically country victoria the name ned kelly can be said and conveniently admit in greta he is instead a heroes, the subsistence blood of the precinct of jerilderie varies on the tourists he induced, but in kettering they instead don't forgets that the three policeman thathe'murdered'were from there br br many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing from the old melbourne gaol where he was hanged, to the post office he held up in jerilderie a cell he was once held in in greta is on display in benella and the site of annjones'hotel, the station and even the logs where he was captured in glenrowan can be visited br br evidence of all the events in the movie (except for his love interest) can be found all over victoria, in police records and even in the sash that ned was awarded with for rescuing dick shelton from drowning none of this is wrong, and whats left out would further justify neds actions the horse that ned'stole'was actually stolen by wild wright (the man who ned boxes with after getting out of jail) ned was already in prison when the horse was reported stolen so he couldn't have stolen it br br the jerilderie letter is more than what has been stated before it is not self justification it is ned's biography, an outline of what he stood for and who he was protecting so go ahead and read it, watch the movie and then make up your mind about what ned stood for
