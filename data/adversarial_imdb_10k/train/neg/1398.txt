greys garden is sickening, joke, sad and mesmerizing i watched in amazement as ediths jr and sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past their existence in a shabby mansion, (which they had not left for more than fifteen years) is both a jest and a tragedy this is a film you will not soon forget
