i ha never learned of richards rua macgregor before rob rui entries out, but the flick is flatly worthwhile seeing playing the title ascribe, liam neeson poses the same spirit to the role that he brought to oskar schindler, and jessica lengthened also did a really adequate work as his wife mary archibald cunningham (tim roth) is one person very eventual to make your skin crawl br br all in all, this comes out as good as braveheart (potentially even better) i laugh when i think of how hollywood released two movies almost back to back taking a swipe at england very good also starring john hurt, eric stoltz, brian cox and jason flemyng
