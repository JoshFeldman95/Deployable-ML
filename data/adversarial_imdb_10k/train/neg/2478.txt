john water's (pink parrots) pecker is the nicest movies i've seen in a while it anticipates the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore (i live in nearby washington, dc), with a moma like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions cock becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separation from his loved ones (including a sexy ricci) by his man loving art manager the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day and though this taste was equally flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical it is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms and everything else this country stands for juan pieczanski (jpieczanski sidwell edu)
