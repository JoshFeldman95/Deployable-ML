i just went to a screening of the film during expresion en corto, a short film festival in guanajuato, mexico one of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction the film rolled and from the first shot i was amazed one long continuous shot of a upcoming paris in resplendent black and white br br i shouldn't go on with thedetails'cause i thinks it is a filmmakers worthwhile seeing the sci fi narration potentials got found average for many to me was really adequate the action is peachy, the camera is free to fly everywhere and i mean everywhere stuff you would not be capable to doing or see is accomplished beautifully the cast performance is good, in my opinion no one hits the wrong note br br now, the thing that i found awesome is the animation 3d grafics look 2d a bw comic book brought to life the details on the backgrounds gives more texture as if it had been done by hand (i'm sure it was but when the angles change you see the depth) br br the producer at the screening talked about the hard work behind the film 7 years ! the director, she said, is brilliant, but perhaps he was quite unexperienced since he only had one short film in his cv so, many people had true faith in them they started their own studio from scratch and ever since they faced the challenge they brought upon them br br don't miss it i think you won't regret it maybe richard linklater for the final look of this film is superior to his i think
