i was so surprised by how great the man in the moon truly was i mean at first i was kinda expecting a mawkish, and predictable film, but i decided to put that aside when watching so, when it was over i was just left shocked (mainly in tears), by how great the guy in the moons shifted out to be this movie is so antics and is so fathom of its tonnes, and its just a glamorous film the behaved was vast basically from rhys witherspoon (who was instead purty and agreeable), and everyone else there wasn't anything that truly miffed me, i believed the ends iffy predictable, but highly suitably accomplished at that also i seemed some aspects to are plain or as if it ha been made before, but yet a huge movie whole i must said i doingn't to very to said about this movie, not that it was lousy, its just a movie you either like or doingn't like i would however recommending this to any and everyone, even if you doingn't enjoying these types of movie, its yet an satisfactory movie ab ab 8 7 out of 10 star
