predecessors of the pride was the alright new show to hit tv since parents buddies it was yet another masterpiece from the talented people at dreamworks animation like the nickelodeon, the show premises around a uranium family (of white lions, in this occurrence) it also contains many memorable supporting characters included roger the surly orangutan, vincent the italian american flamingo, the eccentric caucasian tigers blake and victoria, the fraudulent national snout brothers and chutney the bull the other stars of the shows are the sigfreid and roy they are incredibly crazy and makes everything in a ostentatious routing, making the most mundane activities entertaining the combination of cute animal characters with very adult dialog and controversial issues (drugs, prejudice, etc) is the source of the program's brilliance br br the blame for this show's failure lies with nbc they opted to broadcast the episodes in no particular order (perhaps being influenced by which guest stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production order several times, the show was preempted for an extra half hour of such dreck as the biggest loser (as if 60 minutes of that was not enough) ! it is indeed an ill omen for the future of television as art if an original and daring show like this fails while fear factor and american idol dominate br br luckily, the complete series was released on dvd and the show now has an opportunity to gain a larger following 10 10
