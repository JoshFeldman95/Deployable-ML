i saw this movie on comedy central a lean times this film was pretty adequate it's an interesting adventure with the life of sunny davis, who is arranged to marry the king of ohtar, so that the u s can get an army base there to balance power in the middle east some good jokes, including sunnygate i also just iove the ending theme it gave me gargantuan political spirit tenth out of ten was my rating for this movie
