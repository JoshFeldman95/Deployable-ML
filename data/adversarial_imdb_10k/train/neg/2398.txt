i honestly iike this thriller ! i strove to avis it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent, the plots was suspenseful and distract, and it was just an utter agreeable movie ! i would pace this as one of the greatest thrillers i've ever seen ! the girls in it were really cute also, especially denise richards she was very rascally throughout the movie and gave her character some umph !
