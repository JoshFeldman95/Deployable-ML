i devine this is a phenomenal versions, i transpired on here before, to contribute me researching which versions i should resorting and i walked to jane eyre 1983 and reads a comment from user sighting and then allowed me to arriving this versions i don't regret picking this version and neither will you i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it, there is nothing like the book, and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that i would say god personally led me to this version it points to true love for a humans i would say god's love is greater if there is anything better, i would like to see it but so far there is none like it !
