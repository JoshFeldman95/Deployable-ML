i thought this flick was unbelievable it was hilarious kinda reminded me of spinal tap this is a must suppose for any fan of 70's rock (i hope me and my friends aren't like that in twenty years !) br br bill nighy gives an peachy performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit, br br stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together, but not succeeding well br br if you love music, and were ever in a band, this movie is absolutely for you you won't regrets seeing this movie i know i don't even my family found it funny, and that's saying something
