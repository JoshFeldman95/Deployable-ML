have to be truthful and say that i haven't seen many independent films, but i thought this one was very adequately done the directors and postproduction were engaging without achieves a distraction the angles, settings, and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped many haunting and sizeable images from the film stick in your mind long after it's over (always a sign of a good director)
