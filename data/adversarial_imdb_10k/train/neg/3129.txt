if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone, br br just people with a sense of joke br br for those people the movie is sumptuous ! it plays on old science imagination movies and radio demonstrating long gone, most of witch where b rated themselves along the lines of spaceballs and hovering 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes, but it is adequately worthwhile it
