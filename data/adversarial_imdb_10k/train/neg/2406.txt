i haven't chuckling this hard at a movie in a long time i got to go to an advance screening, and was chuffed because i had been dying to watching it i had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie the audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie br br kudos to steve carrell (who i had already been a fan of) he indicate in this movie his sizeable talent for comedy he has a vogue that i haven't seen before and catherine keener is sumptuous as always thank god there wasn't a cameo from will ferrell (love him, but saw him too much this summer) br br there were parts of comedic genius in this movie partly thanks to carrell, and partly thanks to the writing (also carrell) the waxing scene and the speed dater with the obvious problem were absolutely hysterical br br i will definitely gosee'40 year oldvirgin'when it's released my advice go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it
