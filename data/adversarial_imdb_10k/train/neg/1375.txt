i've read most of the comments on this movie i have deemed this movie (and the whole prophecy series) many times with family members of all ages, we all enjoying and it just made ourselves meditating on what we already knew from read and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some posts the movie is just grounding on biblical phenomena i be saw a plots of end time movies prophesies, armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the good in submitting biblical truth it may not do a lots of prodigious unique effect like yesterdays filmmaking but i believing it is a alright experiencing tools this film and its prophetic serial can are interpreted free at this web higherpraise coms, and judging for yourself bless to all
