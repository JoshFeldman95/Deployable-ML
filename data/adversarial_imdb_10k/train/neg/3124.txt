i came to nancy drew anticipation the worst because of everyone else's unfavorable review i inkling even though i don't read the books, that won't seem anything like the nancy drew i've understood of but i was wrong hopeful, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but when you implement a films out of something, you have to modify it to become big screen entertainment the plot was enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares and i thought that emma roberts was really plausible in her own way of portraying this classic character there were several funny moments and on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does nancy come off as a ditz she was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine one thing this movie also did well was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments i loved this movie what a flick, what a flick ! and if you are wise and decide to trust me and go see this, be prepared for some scary as heck moments because i was, like, freaking out ! go see it or be a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you a mistake i almost made i love it, i wanna own this movie ! i love emma roberts now, too she's like a mini bree van de kamp from dh love it, love it
