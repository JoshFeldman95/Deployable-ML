this is a unimaginably write and well acted psychological drama it is not surely a horror flick so those researching for something like the ring or the grudge will is disappoints what really dismayed me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to constitute internally consistent i also appreciated the absence of dr phil psychobabble or new age revisionism rather than advancing an agenda, the directors just told the story, stated it well and let the viewer think about it the sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of wyeth paintings and amazingly effective br br a great example of how to make a good film on a small budget, without big studios, star actors, big name directors (this was far better than many of hitchcock's films), special effects or clever plot twists
