for my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to have human trafficking after some explores on the internet, i found this dvd and ordered it i just terminating watching it and i am still thinking about it all i can talk is wow it is such a incontrovertible story of a 12 year old cambodian girl named holly and an american man named patric who intention to save her the ending leaves you breathless, and although it's not a happily ever after ending, it is very realistic it is amazing and i advise it to anyone ! you really connect with holly and patric and your heart breaks for her and than of what happens to her i loved it so much and now i want to know what happens next !
