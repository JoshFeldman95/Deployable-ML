this film was such a bursting ! it had that feel good, yet strictly in your deal mentality that relies me to a cinema it possesses a good message (party girl decides she needs a real job) yet she doesn't sufficiently lose all sense of fun i recommending this movie for anyone who needs some humor, but is also a thinker !)
