the filmmaking is hugely satisfactory with a great cast, and excellent direction by james eves the movie is entertaining with a very charismatic performance from stephanie beecham and everyone is perfectly cast terrence eves has a good eye for casting and directs like a conductor recognition exactly when to crank up the action, fall and then rise to a climax he does this with an element of joke, plenty of twists, thrills and blood this is a turnaround of the old vampires movie, with loads of valley, bleeding and screeches the movie operating at a sizeable speed and the character wear you on a peachy misadventures, but what make it working is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously with plenty of tongue in cheek action great !
