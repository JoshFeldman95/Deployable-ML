well i wasn't certain what the film was going to constitute like as i had only saw a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my prefered filmmaking br br i think alison lohan played the part of beth really adequately she is such a grate actors and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is ok and also that hospitals doesn't help bulimics as iv been told which is probably whyi'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
