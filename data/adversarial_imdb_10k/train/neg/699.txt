this movie is best described or compare to big fish (the movie by tim burton) but it's a less glamorous and more in you face tale and of course here it's not the father, but his grandfather who exposes the anecdote ab ab the movies's narrative also moves back and forth (unless the storytelling outline here at imdb, perils warned you more than you would liked to reading, before contemplating the flick) it's funny and perpetrating enough, even though you procure from one stories to another and has some sizeable timing too it also shocked you here and there, with things you wouldn't expect a nice little movie then, that deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like that ! o)
