this is a ok relatives shows with a peachy cast of actors it's a sumptuous breaking from the reality show blitz of late there is nothing else enough like it on tv ok now either, unless you count joan of arcadia as being similar because it has a teen lead character too anyway, clubhouse is worth a look because bermudez sumpter gives the main character (pete young) a kind of likability and naivete that is appealing without being extraordinarily nice and cuddly dean cain, christopher lloyd, mare winningham and kirsten storms round out the rest of the principal cast members, and every is terrific in their role i really like kirsten storms as pete's sister betsy she is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mom and brother, even though she hates to show it it may take a few episodes to really find it's legs, but clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come along in a good long while, so check it out people you'll be glad you did !
