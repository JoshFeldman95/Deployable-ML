if you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy girlfriend, or first puppy love fling this film is for you ! ok so this movie would and goes never success an oscars but as a dominican i appreciated it there are some point in the film that may just proceed allright over your heads if you are not part of the cultures the childlike being increases by a granny who's both mummy and grandfather, the slightest children being fussed and drained with a cafe bustelo choon (totaly dominicans !), judy being taunted by the vicinity males, abandoning to church and backdrop a preaching candlelight the movie's brilliance was in those small details granted, it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it wasn't meant to be nor was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about latin culture (tip make new friends instead) more of a bitter sweet, faux cumentery, this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously as in the tradition of y tu mama tambien this was simply one boy's coming of age tale i recommend it (especialmente si eres dominicano !) o)
