having the opportunity to watch some of the filming in the slavic village broadway area i couldn't wait to see it's final copy br br viewing this film at the cleveland premier previous friday, i haven't laughed out loud at a comedy in a long time ! it is sizeable slapstick the russo brothers did a fine job directing the entire cast performs their best comedic acting no anemic or dry segments george clooney is one of my favorite actors and he's sumptuous as the crippled secured breaker in this flicks i was most imprest by william h macy as crook riley and michael jeter's as toto they keep you in stitches i believe they have the funniest roles in the entire movie
