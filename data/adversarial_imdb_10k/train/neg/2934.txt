homicide the filmmaking proved to be a good readjustment up to a sufficiently typed, too intended, and justly acted series loose ends were tied up that weren't properly addressed at the end of the final seasons the entire instalment, and especially the movie, imparted a life like stare at life (and death) in baltimore, a culturally unique city with an extremely high murder rate my attraction to the series began long before i moved to baltimore, but once i experienced life here for myself, i realized how realistic it was and the movies certainly retained that spirit i will certainly missed new original episodes of the series, but am very grateful to nbc and the producers and cast for giving us one last glimpse at the dark side of charm city
