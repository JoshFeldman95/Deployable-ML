ralph and mumford, misfits in their own land, achieves duped into being unwitting pawns of synanomess botch doubly upon a time is the storytelling of them, the character they address, and their struggling to set things right with a ridiculously impressive soundtrack and wonderful noises acting by some of the best in the business, this offbeat filmmaking rips the brand br br the animation handling, while same to that of the cut out south parks styles, is much nicer and far more three dimensional if i wantn't know that the animation was this style, i would swear that is was traditional pen and ink if you can watch this film in dolby surround or thx, please do ! you won't really miss anything if you don't, but if you do, you will get much more out of the experience !
