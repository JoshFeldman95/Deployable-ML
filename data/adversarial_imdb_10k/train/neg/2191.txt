who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents \? and which parents don't have unresolved issues with each other \? br br i knowed, that sounds heavy but this is performed for hilarity in the flick, done both the comedy better and the drama better i've incessantly like paul reiser and peter falk, and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too gargantuan for a small movie, i was enchanted from the very first scene br br especially entertaining were the discovery that the son makes about his father as a person and peter falk's monologue about being a hard working, sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point without that scene being acted so well, the movie would have seemed far less nuanced, and the character far less interesting br br nicely done, paul and peter !
