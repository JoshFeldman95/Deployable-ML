i iove this films when i was little today at 17 it is one of my all minute preferable animated films beautiful animation and appealing characters are just three of the problems to loving about this film although miscellaneous persons might not enjoy some of the songs, most of them are well done and go along with the story it focuses on charlie, a snotty loveable hessian shepard who may seem likable to some at first but presumably goes win you over br br not a kiddies movies by any fashion often very dark and horrifying at stage a treat for don bluth amateurs and animation buffs but do maintenance a tissues in handy adgth never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive arguably one of the greatest non disney animated films of all time along with watership down and my neighbor totoro br br bottom line a heavenly masterpiece
