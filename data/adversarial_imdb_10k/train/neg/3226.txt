i'm a fan of tv movies in general and this was one of the allright ones the cast performances throughout were reasonably hardy and there were twists i didn't believing coming before each commercial to me it was kind of like medium meets csi br br did anyone else think that in certain lights, the daughter looked like a young nicole kidman \? are they related in any way \? i'd definitely watching it agin or rent it if it ever emerges to video br br dedee was great haven't saw in her in a lot of things and she did her job awfully realistically br br if you're into to televisions mysteries filmmaking, checked this one out if you ha a opportunity
