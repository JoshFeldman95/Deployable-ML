more like psychological analysis of movies, but psycho does sound better as a header the man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you hope) does depicted movies here in his own way most of them are classics, but all of them are listed here at imdb and i'd strongly advise you to viewing them (especially the hitchcock movies, solyaris, conversation and the lynch movies), because slavoj zizek ambition reference them ! br br or in other words, he might spoil them for you i don't remind if he spoiled more than those i've listed (i envisage the chaplin movies too), but as i wrote it'd be alright if you seeing them all beforehand ! in the imdb included there is a movie foregone, that i did report to them, upon it might gained up there sweet previously it's a meg ryan movie, but it's a only a brief snippet not biggest of a confronting anyways brit brit zizek perceptions and tips are nutjob and chuckles to listen to, if you're introductory minded to see things through another perspective (even if that does obliterated your fave movie a bit for you it doesn't mean it will do that, but it could) !
