this films is astounding it's just like a nightmare the outlandish story, the dark decors, the swarming cockroach everywhere, the idea jumps and the hallucinatory dreams really peachy ! people who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this remarkable it seems a little to the films of david lynch the strange story, the bizarre dreams, the red curtains nuit noire contains almost no plot it's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings, nightmares and meetings that's a drawback if the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement, i would give it a 10 out of 10 but that's missing, and that's why i gave the movie an 8 nuit noire is a film worth watching search that dvd and you'll be rewarded !
