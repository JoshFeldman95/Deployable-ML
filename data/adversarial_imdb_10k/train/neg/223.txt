i've viewed this movie fold now on dvds, and both times it hadn't impossibility to impressing me with its unique impartial behave it appear more iove a depiction of fact than most other hollywood expense, namely on a things that is thereafter flatly discussed even unless it wand intrinsically with the southern insight, it doesn't disappoints to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not subjected what, and cruel is a habitual denominator br br what awfully poses this film great is the reject to over sugarcoat nowadays truly good movies (in a nutshell) are few and far apart, with mainstream fare being enjoyable (if you don't have high expectations), but terribly commercially spirited i think this movie comes off as a truly good movie (without being a masterpiece), because it sticks to itself, and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it, instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence this movie is cool, observant, and generally light handed in its judgement, which is good br br the story has its flaws, especially jewel's character comes off doubtfully, but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic, that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life, even by liberally taking each next guy still she doesn't come off as weak, in fact i think she's one of the stronger characters, she's always in control of the relationships, with the men just tagging and i take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow i believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now you could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so the prospect of of someone dying, while surely causing grief, didn't traumatise people like it does now people didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now, and i like that attitude br br my recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie, if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare don't watch if if you want non stop action or heart renting emotion
