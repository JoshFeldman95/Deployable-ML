have just finished watching this film, which upset me greatly have also been to south africa twice, around the time this film is set br br it is definately troublesome pummeled, and the opening scenes tend to'set the scene' the sluggish but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break, and there are certainly few light moment br ab wants never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again he came across as a very twisted individual, and i found myself disliking him more each timeframe he appeared br br totally agree with steve thomp's articulate and well thought out comments
