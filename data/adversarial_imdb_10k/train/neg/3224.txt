this film is peachy as often heard, it is indeed awfully realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people i am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing, negativistic or dismantling austria as a proto fascist community much the contrary while there are indeed some far weighty scene in hundstage and some characters are to remain calling very bad beings, at the same time you watch love, cutie and irreverent in ulrich seidls film and that's exactly what distinguishes hundstage for me from other films that try to appears the llfe ofthe'ordinarypeople'in an severe, realist way their hustle, their wishes, their dark sides seidl clearly never tries to prove, that the lives of the working class people are trash ! in my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting, that nearly nobody's live isas'clean'and'normal'as we would like other people to believe and that every live has its dark and often depressing sides the most beautiful scene the old viennese man, watching his old girldancing'the oriental way', as he is calling it i think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto fascist the characters in hundstage or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70 year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover
