do you like really inventive comedy or do you love the wedding crashers, if the answer is the latter stop reading now i can't watching this movie is not higher rated basically meadows plays a character not unlike austin powers there are so many inventive min in this gagorama from crudity leon playing with himself on the porch, the ex boyfriend tricked into eating oh well to inspired lunacy clown sex, the broadway routine, the voice over meadows is great as the childish, but terribly sugary natured leon some whopping lines don't blame the wang freaky deaky sex world too many why this movie wasn't huge is a mystery great comedy
