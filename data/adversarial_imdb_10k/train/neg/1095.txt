this is an admirable film about the characters in a adult swimming class, their problems, relations and interactions with each other it shouldnt has managed a large distribution as it's severely nicest than equal films from major studios out at the same time br br the swims instructor is an almost olympian, diminishes to educating mature basic lessons, and often the meta of horndogging from his girls students he attempts, more or less, to marauding them off, with varying results br br the students character are mainstream umm s a teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, all of whom haven't learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships, including friends, relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder, including a teacher going through a divorce, some high school students making a documentary, and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys br br this is a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality
