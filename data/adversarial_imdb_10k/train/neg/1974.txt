i iike watch people doing breakdance, especially if they do it as well as in the better scenes of this filmmaking which assumes you to a disco club termed roxy especially at christmas time, because there also appears a mc santa claus br br even if this is an old film, and even if i have videotaped it from tv, when the state movie archive of finland showed this in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, i went there to checked it out it's much more good on big screen than on tv br br even if many individuals here contemplate that watching this on big screen is a waste of money for the ticket cost, i disagree with this and i think that when i paid my ticket, i got the money's worth by seeing this, as it is on big screen, especially seated on front row of the cinema, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just on video
