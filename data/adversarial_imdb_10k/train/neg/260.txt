this zippy and agreeable short from 1916 the time when charlie chaplin and fatty arbuckle were the big names in comedy features the young oliver hardy as ane'er do well who has to quickly impress his wealthy uncle by producing a wife and baby for his visit br br of course this does not go smoothly and immediatly there are satisfactorily more wives and babies than he can cope with plus the mandatory chases and misunderstandings that are the hallmark of early movie slapstick br br salvaged allright it can be viewed as partof'the early films of oliverhardy'and is now available on dvd, a lovely addition to the available corpus of the big screen favourite comedy duo
