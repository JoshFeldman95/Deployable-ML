i watched this eventual afternoon on tv (hbo) i have to admit, that the tension in this movie was unsurpassed by most other fn era movies i loved the pleas chip would be all peaceable one moment and then violent the very next moment it was classic ahh yes the dames, the villians, the cigars and thuggish cops ! it has it all this movie handed all the tovar to me i especially loved the way they mixed communists into the plot, very common for this era of movie very barefaced also since blacklisting was popular in those days i rate this movie one of the best i have seen in the fn genre !
