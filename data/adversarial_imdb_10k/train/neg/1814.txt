uh, it's over the top, uh it's a stung cliched and yes, constance marie is a total babe and defensible of seeing again and again ! the humor and gags likelihood obtaining yesteryear and repetitious after a while but the showed's still fun to watch since it's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and premonition in between the gags br br george lopez is funny don't take him seriously and the show's a winnersi'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue his outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious br br i do have to say that the one big, dark, bitter spot is benny i hate the character so much so that anytime she's on for more than 30 seconds i mute the tv just so i don't have to hear her there is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes as a mother she has to be the worst out there and i am just shocked and surprised that george, as the character, would stand by such a deplorable person for so long br br even so anytime i get ticked off at seeing benny i think to myself seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the bill engvall show now there's a bad sitcom
