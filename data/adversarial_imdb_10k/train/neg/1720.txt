amazing film that, in theory, envisaged be bores but is delivered with subtlety and unbelievable acting that i have long abhorred of ever finding instead of relying on platitudes and disproportionately dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic times the lead personality are not perfect, and so regarding to them as people you could know is easy the movie is not trying to pull laughs, or push an ideal onto the audience but simply indicating us the likelihood of true love in any actuality br ab i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel a moving, thought provoking, funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's will soften even the hardiest heart
