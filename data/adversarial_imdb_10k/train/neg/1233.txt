i really thought they did an excellent job, there was nothing wrong with it at all, i don't know how the first commenter could have tell it was terrible, it moved me to tears (i guess it moved about everyone to tears) but i try not to cry in a movie because it's embarrassing but this one gets me it was definetly ok ! i hoping they liberation it on bluray than i wants definitely buy a copy ! i suppose like it renovating my belief and dispensed me a hoping that i doesn't elaborate, it waged me want to strive to be a better person, they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted, i guess compared to that, i feel like our own trials are nothing well, not nothing, but they hardly match what they had to go through i loved it who played emma \? !
