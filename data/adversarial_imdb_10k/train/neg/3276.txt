this movie is of almost generation sets pertinent to some of us born in the early post war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it and the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you it's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow appallingly excite moment in our growing up days br br it had a modern, space age storyboard for the audiences of it's juncture the set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a friday midnight show it has hot rods and rebellious youth, but inthe'why can't they let us havefun'way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel without a cause way all characters were identifiable to us teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops were sympathetic to us we could relate to them all br br it had a singularly horrifying monster it's first victim is heardmoaning'it hurts ithurts'and we were convinced and frightened the menace grows continually throughout the story there are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in mcqueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not it even had an almost over the top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying br br i saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billedwith'i married a monster from outer space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that i went back a couple more times before it left everyone i knew saw it everyone i knew loved it
