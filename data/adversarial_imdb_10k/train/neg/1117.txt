i countersigned with everyone who says that this series was the better of the'spy'genre my husband and i were dumbfounded by it when it first aired in the us and sawthe all occurrence i tried at that juncture to buyer the series (i did tape all of it) but was proclaims by wgbh that it was not available i even considered writing to ian holm to see if he might have a copy ! like others, i purchased and read the deighton series (in part to understand the complicated plot) if the original version ever comes available on dvd, i'll be among the first in line to snap up a copy ian holm's portrayal of the vulnerable but courageous bernard samson was amazing (he is always amazing)
