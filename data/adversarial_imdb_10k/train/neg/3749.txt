ok, i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grouchy reviews but i did enjoy it i didn't laugh out loud, but it obligated my interest and sacked me along without toppling me at any point the story built uh, you knew it would have an happy ending this genre always does meantime, it was quirky with sight gags you could miss, so pay attention when you watch stiller and black delivered clumsily yet again agreeable team they should work together more don't learns that it will be a cult classic, but it was certainly a fun ride not as good as what about bob, or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is \? it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie
