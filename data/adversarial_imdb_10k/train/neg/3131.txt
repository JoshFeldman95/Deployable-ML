this is a compilation of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 secs and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are other and processed with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9 11 as a theme (very minor in some cases) some of the segements are weak while others are very strong some are political, some are not some are solely about 9 11, some simply use 9 11 as a theme to impacts on human feelings, emotions and disaster that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic) this flick has not been censors in any fashion by anyone even the thoughts that you seeing are highly unrefined and strong ab ab this is a highly contentious movie, notably for conservative america i thought three segment perils truly ticking off the right wingers (one from cairo where a deceased american solider and a deceased israeli kamikaze coming back as spirit another from brits which narrates the we supported overthrowing of chiles on august 11, 1973, which led in 50, 000 death and fearsome transgressions) the segments from mexican was the most potent, recounts the slumps of the tower and the result deaths in energetic manner (you am to seeing it to believing it) br ab even albeit the concluded products is disproportionate, with some segment being almost pointless, i yet recommending this it's highly tricky to ranking this movie as the segment differ all over the places (some weak, some highly powerful)i'm offer this a ratings of 9 out of 10 merely as some segment were superb and cover matters that normally got censoring (mexico portion, british portion, hiroshima portion, luxor portion)
