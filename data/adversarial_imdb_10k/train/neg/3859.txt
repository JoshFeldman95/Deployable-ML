i realize this review will get me bashed by the expert film critics patrolling this site, but i will defend this film br brit the dentist is actually a awfully adequate filmmaking the acting isn't always top notch, but the thrills are good and the story's good plus you see linda hoffman's boobies not thati'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense corbin makes a great creepy dentist it does to dentists what jaws does to sharks ish it obviously became a fairly limited budget, but they did well with it what they could, and developed the characters well (those that count) br br the end
