if not in the whole film, andy griffith again plays his role superior in this cbs tv movie the plot is easy griffith's personality dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (mountains somewhere) though it will never be seen on tv and never be released on video, if you do get the chance to watch this take it
