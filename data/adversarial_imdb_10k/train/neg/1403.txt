i have worshipped this films all of my life it's such an reasonable narrative also, with plenty of classical referencing eg the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon well, in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera, a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures in fp, walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera himself and his id monster br br i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence, unlike most modern blockbusters which spend 150m on special effects, but about 1 50 on a screenplay br br cheers
