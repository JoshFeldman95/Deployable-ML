this flick chances not put the catholic church in the decent illuminating but it is proclaims a stories built on real event unfortunately not everything in life, include religion, are all nice and rosy sometimes humans and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in retrospective don't look as phenomenal as they once did a luv divided tells the story of a family, yes it does incorporate religion, but really the storytelling is about a household, and that family's ability to stay together no regard what is thrown at them this filmmaking is also founded on true events which is not to say that this story, scene by scene, is true, but if you were to look at news articles from that time period you would be able to see that neither churches handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family both churches are at fault here, the catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight in this case both let this family down i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church, just the opposite, it shows how one incident can change the course of that religion's ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves
