tripping over i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but having faith in the show, and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent, i continued to watch i can safely sayi'm now glad that i did the story did develop somewhat well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most don't have any information missing br br the only thing i can culpa in this production is the marginally annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie br br some good acting coupled with a admirable plot really gets this show over the line here's to hoping for another season !
