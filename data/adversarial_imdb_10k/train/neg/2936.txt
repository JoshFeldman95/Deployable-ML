to all the reviewers on this page, i would have to say this film is worthy seeing so it was executed in 1972, so what the attire in the movie was scrupulously the same fashion of its time people who didn't study culture of the decades would contemplation that this flick is a cheese ball likened to the modern series, ` left behind,' (which is made for our juncture right now) it do look cheezy however, the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion, which again was over 30 years in the past but the message that is sent in this film is very powerful, and carefully preserved there is just so much to say, but i refuse to say it (for fear of spoiling it) so go out and see this film ! if you don't like the message that it sends, then you have issues, that need some attention !
