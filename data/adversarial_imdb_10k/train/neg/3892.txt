in watching how the three brothers communicative and eats off of any other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to proceed to montana to fish or be besides to do so it is amazing i can not visualise of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt do yourself justice and watch one of the preferable movies in the modern movie era seriously recommending and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming, don't try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie
