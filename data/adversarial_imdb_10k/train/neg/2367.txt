i gotta say, clive barker's enduring is by far the preferable horror game to have ever been made i've played resident evil, silent hill and the evil dead and castlevania games but none of them enjoy captured the pure glee with which this games considers its horrific elements barker is adequate at what he does, which is attach the horror to our world, and it shows as his hand is clearly everywhere in this game heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters full of lush visuals and enough atmosphere to shake a stick at, undying is the game to beat in my books as the best horror title i just wish that this had made it to a console system but alas poor pc sales nipped that one in the bud
