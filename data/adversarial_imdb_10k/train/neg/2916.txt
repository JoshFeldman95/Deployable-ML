the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones the humor involved in the character is not inconvenience humor, and is also character fed enough to be stretched out for an hour or two br br oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided, but that may has been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it i suppose i was thinking more leisure suit larry risque than the producers were br br definitely not a pg 13 movie, which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors, but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones br br i liked it, but i doubt it will be a smash hit (which is sad, as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to)
