is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story \? maybe, hell, you knows how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her br br i think this films wantto follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't affirm anything about the content there are gargantuan scenes with crispen glover, dennis hopper, and gary busey, although short some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done br br this is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it the humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile br br there is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids
