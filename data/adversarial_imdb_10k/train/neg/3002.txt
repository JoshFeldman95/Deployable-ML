this moviemaking seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids flick that parenting can wretchedly watch with their mostly entertained little kids the movie seems and is mostly geared towards kids yet it does not stop on this level i watched this movie first as a youthful child and found it to be funny, funnier, and consoling and did not see it again for several years i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as consoling and distracting this movie is terribly unappreciated and contains many messages of real life this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for children yet manas in its owned rights i recommending this film to anyone of any ages
