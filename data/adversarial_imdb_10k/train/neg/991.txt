turned out to either a tasteful production with what must have been a low budget the diversification of characters is unbelievable, from axe wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls ! i appreciated the relationship between the leads, not overly sappy but unrequited enough to keep the interest going i also appreciated the mix of funny (which can be very easy to get wrong, too considerable not enough) which meant it didn't find too darkness, nor too spoofy it was a admirable step up fromeaves'other efforts, hellbreeder and sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out can't wait for bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic
