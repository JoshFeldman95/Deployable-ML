this film is one of the purest american b movies of the 90s if you're looking for a serious film, look elsewhere however, if you're looking for some action, a lot of snickering, and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters, this is suitably worthwhile watching everyone chews the scenery a bits, but that's really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny donald sutherland and john lithgow have admirable chemistry and need to do another film together
