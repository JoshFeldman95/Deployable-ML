i relished the night listener very much it's one of the advisable movies of the summer br br robin williams gives one of his preferable spectacle in fact, the entire cast was very adequate all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a unbelievable comic impacts toni collette is great as the mom, and never subsides over the top everyone is very believable br br it's a short movie, just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie br br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion, which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well br br don't be sucker punched by the previews and ads it is not a hitchcockian thriller see the night listener because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed br br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a minor quibble
