i had no expectations i'd never heard of jamie foxx all i knew was that the film has some strong character actors in it i thought it was overly entertaining it was fun the plot was different and unpredictable enough to hold my interest to me, foxx is an original david morse is peachy (true, this is not his finest role) i thought the pursues and firework succour to the flick and were well done i wouldn't expects a lot and i was conveniently dumbstruck
