i luvwatching'' oceanhunt'' back in the day, i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4 30 would be ready towatch'' seahunt'' and bob anderson in his underwater adventures i iove it ! he took to you a places not very accessible at that time, under the great blue seapre''thunderball'' or even before cousteau became common, there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids i'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show underwater photography also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show watch and enjoy ! ! !
