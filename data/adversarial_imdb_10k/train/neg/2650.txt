this film quite literally has all single action movie cliche and all of them effort to its advantage straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this film with such careless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain there are tanks, helicopters, machine gun battles, grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one danny trejo and if you don't know who danny trejo is then you decidedly won't like this film
