i aime this movie ! it's truly bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, wry it makes no sense to tell about the contents of the movie, so then i'd be giving out the outcome ! you have to seeing it without recognising what is it about ! everything is connection and has its why than it starts subtly and then the things start rolling faster and faster until they culminate in the most insane outburst you can imagine ! it's even more fun to watch the films the second timing, once you know all the tricks the actors are peachy, especially ivan trojan, whose final scenes are a actual master piece ! i highly recommend this film, it's one of the most original ones i've ever seen !
