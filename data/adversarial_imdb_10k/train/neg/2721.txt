what could sont more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they're supposed to be spying on \? and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal br br but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense you can see real people behind the unreal lines and the directing is sumptuous each scene does just what it has to and ends without drag on too long br br i showed this to several friends in the mid 80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a adequate film the pals benefitted it too
