after boston, i was beginning to lose all respect for richard gere and then along been the herd there's just so far a nice smirk and a couple of stock facial gestures can get you, but he proved to me that he's later gotten hold of his craft and can act with the nicest of them clare danes was also super as his trainee replacement some have suggested there was too sizeable extraneous violence, but i amn't see it that way nothing i saw detracted from the faculties of this filmmaking i was really shocked i hadn't heard of it being released in theaters and came across it at blockbuster instead really an exceptional film with just the right blend of action, suspense, thrills, and social consciousness as good as 7even \? well, maybe and you'll see better acting out of gere than anyone's ever gotten out of pitt
