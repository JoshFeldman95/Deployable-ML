very ok except for the ending which was a huge disappointment br br the script was very good as was the acting the visuals were ordinarily very grainy but this in a itineraries added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film this plaguing was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ends br br i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever br br this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good
