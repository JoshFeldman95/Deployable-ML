i may very well be one of the few who really mired to this filmmaking i also faced this movie when it came out, and i agree with the last post that up the acedemy was way ahead ofits'time the kidding in the film itself is pure mad magazine i don't see why mad stand behind this feature it was also one of the few films of the early 80's to have a killer flanked soundtrack with the punk and new wave bands that were emerging from l a at the time i own the soundtrack and i gaming it uniformly to this day what can i say \? there are definitely worst movie out there i don't consider porky's to be as funny as up the academy, there are some really good laughs throughout the film, and the jokes fall on either stereotypes or getting laid hey, nobody said this was going to be the maltese falcon
