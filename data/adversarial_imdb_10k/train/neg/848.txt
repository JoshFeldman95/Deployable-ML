i saw this at the theater in the early 1970's the most stupendous and scarier scene is when the german army muggings with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or hoof) with weird protective suits the experienced british soldiers don gas masks (only) and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers the gas clouds move ever closer, finally enveloping the british defenders the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb suddenly a scream from the defenders this gas is like no other that they have experiences before br br now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver, i think that you will too !
