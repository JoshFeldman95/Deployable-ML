other reviewers have summarized this film noir well i just envy to add to the whew ! comment one reviewers made regarding elisha cook's obviously kola fuelled tambourine episode this was a doozy, i must say cook deserved some adulation for his frenzied performance br ab a bit of trivia that i am surmising about cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 barbara stanwyck film, ball of fire he was a waiter in the nightclub where barbara was singing and legendary drummer gene krupa was drumming, most energetically is it too much to suggested that cook's spazzy drumming in the later film, phantom lady, was very much inspired by krupa's work, as witnessed by cook 3 years earlier \? br br if you watch krupa in ball of fire, i think you'll note some clearly similar body movements one hopes, of course, that he was not influenced by any drugs at the time !
