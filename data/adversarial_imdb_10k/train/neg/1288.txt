i adore ashley goode and supposing all of her movies are great ruby br br in paradise is one of her preferable it is a very overstated movie that you really have to watch close to appreciate it a story of a woman trying to make it on her own and refusing to give in to temptations that would make her life easy some of her movies such as kiss the girls and time to kill probably did better at the box office and video rentals they were very good movies br br also, but take the time to really look at ruby and i think you will unanimous it is one of ashley's best br br
