i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm were not really appreciative their real lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i e what they were the movie does a adequate job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful unknowns and a beautiful european metropolis, but flatly about the deeper discussion about their values of life many flick are like this in mots of scrutinize of the definitions of lives or love or relationships or current misfortunes in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions
