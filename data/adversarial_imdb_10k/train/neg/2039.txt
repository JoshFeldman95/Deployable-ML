i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney (whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit) and his ocean's 11 director steven soderbergh worse, we opted this up in a disregarding bin for 4 99 (canadian dollars at that !) what a sizable and pleasant surprise but theni'm of the opinion that if william h macy is in it you can't constitutes disappoints this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s ok, with more profanity this is an oddball and at times gut splittingly funny film the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast best 5 i've spent in ages
