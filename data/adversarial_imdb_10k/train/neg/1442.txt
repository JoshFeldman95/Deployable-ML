i obtains considered this flick sizeable timing and i like all horrid teachers want to give it dozen out of dozen but considering that it would be unreasonable to other good films however, i do feel that this is one of those dearth gems a perfect comedy it is i would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times matthau and lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatch the scripts is so sharp that you mandatory to staunch the blood the story is even known and is already been described in other remark the two leads give extraordinary performances, the girls are superb and the situations are side splittingly funny not one swear word in sight (mark that hollywood, you don't have to swear to be funny, you have to be witty) and the move from stage to film is seamless they don'tmake'em like this any more timeless
