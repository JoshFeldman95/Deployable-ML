george lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't but this show is a work of art it's not ever show where the humor conservancy you laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re stupendous at that) this show just has an cheerful seems to it and the character range from an old, short drunk to an dyslexic teenager i don't knowthat who writes this show but that person does a huge job if they had just continued the showi'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country if you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then george lopez is the show for you ! the one bad thing is the title george lopez \? really \? imagine the fresh prince of bel air being will smithc'mon man ! but otherwise, this show is genius ! 10 10
