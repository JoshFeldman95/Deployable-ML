i was watching this movie at one of my usual time, which is real real late at night usually if a movie doesn't pertinent me, i start falling dozing and have to raid the fridge to stay awake br br at first i thought that's what i had to do unless this movie's pacing erupted off slow, along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time but after a bit, i start fetch more into the movie, as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling by the end, you feel like you've known him your whole life the movie kept my interest so much that i didn't even know the sun was about to rise br br not much of lynch's bizzare style, but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing
