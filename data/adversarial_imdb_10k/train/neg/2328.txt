i remember consider this on tv in the late 70s and it stayed with me ! it's purty, audible, colourful a peachy kids filmmaking i put it on for some colleagues at a party recently and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a lea meet the feebles but no its wholesome clean fun br br jacks wild is in okay manner, as is mamma cass, and the somehow attractive witchy poo br br if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re create that hallucinatory childhood saturday morning vibe ! br br even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away ! quality tv movie if, like me, you are into death metal you'll love it !
