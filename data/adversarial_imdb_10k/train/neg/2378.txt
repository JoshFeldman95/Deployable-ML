i first endured this video 15 annum ago i figured it was excellent then and i still do i am a former teacher of english (high school and college) and a lover of english romantic poetry, so coleridge rates terribly with me anything which might entertain from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story wouldn't achieving my ballot of excellence in this circumstances, everything works well to perpetrate the viewer, extremely senior school demanded the story is also stated for a generations which growing up on tv in addition, the voices of michael redgrave adds a sense of authenticity and authorize to it ok, than there wasn't a big budget for the project so it wasn't star wars and there's no cgi in it but who can dismiss gustave dore illustrations as part of the presentation \? the comment above, which in just four lines dismisses the video as a piece of trash, is grossly unfair and unperceptivei'm a friend of the producer, but that isn't my reason for this comment rather,i'm defending a work of artistry which i think has value on all levels it is well suited to bring coleridge's poem to students in a way which awakens their appreciation of it and awakens their sympathy for the lesson which the ancient mariner imparts
