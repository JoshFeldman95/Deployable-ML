i don't like grade inflation but i just were to give this a 10 i can't idea of anything i didn't like about it i seen it latest midnight and asleep up tuesdays thinks about iti'm sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about, with j lo and richard gear, will be excellent, but this rudimentary japanese versions from 1996 was so mental and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to idea of any way that it could be improvement, or its setup evolved to a disjointed culture br br a tale i encountered valuable glancing, and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort ! imagine that ! br br all the characters seemed well developed, even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting, and the casting seemed very appropriate br br it's always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age, and perhaps this doesn't quite qualify (there is plenty of learning how to dance, but no singing) but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man, successful with a family in japan, looking for something he knows not precisely what br br to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film, thank you for creating and doing it
