i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show person i cannot comment any more than what ex viewers have stated and to the featured, plot and ensemble quality of this film without echo their especial words perspective the cameo, out of character appearances of so sizeable m gram m silent stars is worth the see in and of itself i effectively like the scenes where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie, patricia pepoire make sure you read her lips as there is no title card indicating what she is saying when she suppose marion atkinson but it is something to the effect of i don't think i like her ! pop the corn, pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy !
