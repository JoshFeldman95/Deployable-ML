i've watched it sufficient of times andi'm planning on buys the full feature i love all of zach steele's comedy it's very different and unique and is very enjoyable i love indie films and this one is just gargantuan the plots is strange but very funny this short film is about a talking spatula named edward the order of the events are a piece unreadable, having this film very interesting to watch at first you see edward fighting the spoon, but then the focus changes to earlier in his life this is a ridiculous movie, but of course, it's still great i highly suggestion that you seeing this movie at http spatulamadness coms or www filmcow coms it's highly laughter the humor may not matching everyone's fondness but watch anyway it'll only taking 16 mins of your times, and it's free going watched spatula lunacy !
