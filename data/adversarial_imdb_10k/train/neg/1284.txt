but the fun is in the journey br br i found this movie to be extremely agreeable, not only are both leads extremely simple on the squinting, the irreverent from the supporting cast and the gags actually made me laugh out loud umpteen time br ab uh, it's predictable, and uh, it's a cliche romantic comedy but the point is that it's a nice stories, the message about finding your one true love also rings veritable in divergent approach ab ab the dialog is dead on and the acting is suitably proceeded on all parts, and over the top for comic effect the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention ! for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing then you want a thriller this is a romantic comedy it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way br br great date movie, great movie for a happy cry
