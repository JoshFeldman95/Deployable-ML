baby facial is a prematurely paced, wise cracking, understand smirk of a film that br br widens only an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a brainy 75 minutes they br br are ! that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a br br short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame screenwriters of br br ora should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that br br overwhelms so many of their films br br the story is no codswallop an amoral woman rises to wealthy first under, br br and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her br br sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming, happy ending, br br but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to br br go, so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a br br hapless suitor not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one if br br you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable br br or rent the cassette it's worth the effort
