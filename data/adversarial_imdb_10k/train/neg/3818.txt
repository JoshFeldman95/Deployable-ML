cat soup at first seems to be a very random animated film the best way i've been able to explain it is that it's quite acidic though it's not totally random the tale is about nyatta, a young cat boy and his sister nyaako nyaako is awfully deficient and dies, however, nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and is able to retrieving half of it the stories is about their quest to bring nyaako fully back to life br br without a lot of the content in this movie seems completely randomness, it is not most of it is symbolize for lifetimes, death and rebirth you can also see references from other tales, such as hansel and gretal this strangely cute short film has an interesting story, packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen
