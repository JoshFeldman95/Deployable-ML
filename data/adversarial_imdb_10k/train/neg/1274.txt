i saw this film (it's english title is who's singing over there \?) at the 1980 montreal international film festival it won raves then and disappeared a terrible ignominy it is brilliant unbelievable, ridiculous, sad, and extremely comical the script is a work of art it's been 19 years and i've seen only a handful of comedies (or any other genre, for that matter) that can match its originality
