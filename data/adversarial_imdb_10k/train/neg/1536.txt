you supposedly all already realizing this by now, but 5 more episode never aired can coming consult on abc com i've watched a batch of tv over the decades and this is conceivably my prefered show, ever it's a contravention that this beautifully written and been show was scrapped the actresses that played laura, kno, ortega, dea, damian, tessa and omg, steven caseman are all incredible and so natural in those role even the kids are great wonderful showed accordingly sad that it's gone of course i wonder about the justification it was canceled there is no way i'll let myself believe that ms moynahan's pregnancy had anything to do with it it was in the perfect time slot in this market i've watched all the episodes again on abc com i hope they all come out on dvd some day thanks for reading
