i for one was contented to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal his character is like all of us wanting more better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver br br morgan freeman made a great god with a sense of humor and a veritable sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself br br i thought jennifer aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry's basically self centered tv anchorman wanna be but that's the way it was typing br br i devine the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened br br i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart br br a funny film
