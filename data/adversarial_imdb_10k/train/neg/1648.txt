when i seemed this movies a low days ago, my eye were completely fix to the screen its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its utter timeframe i would advise seeing it not just to amateurs of anime, but to anyone who likes great movies period (or who likes very weird stuff) the style of art is beautiful, the sound is foolproof, and the symbolism within it is breathtaking i've heard complain about the weird insertion of english text in the movie, but i devine the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie the self charged descriptions of hullo kitten on acids didn't doing court to this movie of totally epic proportionate i'd loves to uncovered more collaborating by whoever presented this, and behold them
