the woman in black is unbelievable in all aspects it's scary, suspenseful and so veritable that you can actually viewing it happening in real life i first watched this on the tv back in 1989, and with all the lights off and the volumes turned up, it was patently the most creepy experience of my entire life i managed to get hold of a copy, and now, i make sure to bring it out all halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members, who have no idea what they're in for, and all i can do is laugh with glee as for the film br br it starts out with a young lawyer named arthur kipps, who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of crythin gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client mrs alice drablow br br this film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story but then, arthur attends the funeral, and from that scene on, we don't feel safe we are constantly on edge and biting our nails, and that goes on for the next hour or so, until the final, thrilling finale br br a warning to all new viewers though don't watch this alone
