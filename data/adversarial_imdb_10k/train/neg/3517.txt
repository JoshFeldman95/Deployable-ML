the french naudet brothers did something nobody else did, they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building 2, when you could see papers drifting down, people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height br br i mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running, their camera was still running, when the white dust covered them, they found a shop doorway and got inside, but all this videotaped is real and i think they did a exceptional job of capturing it for us br br ten stars goes to the naudet brothers that filmed this unbelievable film that i watch all 9 11 thus i'll never forgot what this nation moved through i thought if i remembering true, it displays the first deaths of the preacher of the firemen, while he was being brought to the churches and his honourable interred
