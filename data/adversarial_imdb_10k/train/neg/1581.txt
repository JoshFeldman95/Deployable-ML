phenomenal ! my wife and i adhered the sprawling line to see holly at the edinburgh film shindig after seeing the film, i can admit why there was such a long lines holly is a touches histories about an impossible connection between two people she is a young girl, he is a worn out westerner the film grasped every bone in our body there aren't any graphic scenes or anything that is hard to watch its the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut the film is impossibly shot among others, we luv the scene where patrick narrates holly to odometer a small motorcycle thuy ngoyen's rawness (wouldnt believing this is her first behaving jobs) and ronald harrison's performance remained with me for a peers of time eminently recommend
