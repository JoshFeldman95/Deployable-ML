i have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was unequivocally my prefered one the problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie i imagined was more real cause in this one the main character lexi doesn't automatically just get better she gets better and then has a drawback i think this movie shows more than the others that i've sawthe that getting better doesn't just happen, it's difficult working and takes time, it's a long path to recovery i think this movie shows all of that very well there should be more movies like this
