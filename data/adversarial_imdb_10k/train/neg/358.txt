erendira is a flick from mexico that is sparsely talked about the film only constituted in a low quality vhs format it's a shame this film hasn't been given a bluray release erendira is whopping and sumptuous with its magic realist images erendira is basis on a short story from the novel 100 years of solitude erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma's house her evil grandma, played by irene papas, forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages the whole town elicit a piece of erendira, so to speak although the subject matter sounds harsh, the film doesn't exploit sexuality it's done in a mature artistic manner the film also has some amazing costumes some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most, are the origami birds that morph into real birds, and a golden orange with a diamond in the center erendira is an amazing film, that even manages to throw in humor this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release as they'd say in espanol, es muy muy bien ! ! ! excellente !
