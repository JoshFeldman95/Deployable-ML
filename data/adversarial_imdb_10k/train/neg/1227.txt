ok, this movie is stupid i mean that in a good way though it was stupid on purpose, and was one of the better stupid movies i've seen the jokes and gags are resolutely bad, but consigned in a path that it knocked all the exact notes with me the supporting character were exactly facile and mediocre there is a entirely weak plot, but it works just peachy br br elvira's character is the focus here she is lovable and adorable cassandra petersen has a world of acting talent that just glisten in this movie on top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly, stunning few men could disagree with that the parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie br br i had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last br br highly recommended to fans of comedy, and to fans of beautiful women i wish they had made a dozen more elvia movies
