i know multiple people have a special awe for the alistair sim version of dickens'story, but for me, this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this moviemaking on vhs, and we follow it together every christmas eve i conventionally remark that we could watch it on halloween too, because it's a very creepy ghosts mythology br br scott typecast as scrooge is shudderingly mean and nasty, making his transformation all the more miraculous and wiggle i thinking it's up there with his performance in patton the spirits are all reasonable, all one creepier than the definitive viewing the darkened, floating, skeletal form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends shivers down my spine every year and what a supporting cast ! david warner, in particular, is in top form as bob cratchit, as is susannah york as his wife br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others but i may be mistaken, as it's been several years since i read it regardless, this is a terrific christmas classic
