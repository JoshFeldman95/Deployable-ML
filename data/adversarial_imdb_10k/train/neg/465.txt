i awfully can proclaims i sensed the film in its adequate node where the mind games from dreamy reality enter into the surreal aspect of imminent encounter by tom cruise i didn't cared much about tom cruise's acting prowess but i must say that he seems to impress at every point in the movie not simply due to an engaging storyline but also due to his self being imparted to the lead character they merge and then speak and its sumptuous however i must dis this filmmaking doesn't come under the average filmmaking of week which you withheld at haphazard and watch gleefully it carries stiff sentiment and characters so don't wash this one down with your beer and pop corns it certainly needs more than that
