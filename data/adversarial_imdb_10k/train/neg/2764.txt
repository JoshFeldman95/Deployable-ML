this 1991 nbc tv movie scattered eight weeks before john goodman's big screen version of the residing of babe ruth coincided out for my money, there is no comparisons between the three the television production isn't perfect but it prescribes the babe's narratives with more clarification and complicating than goodman's one dimensional telling i especially witnessed the film's depiction of the complex love hate relationship ruth had with yankee manager miller huggins, who always understood his star player's brilliance and also kept trying to point out why ruth's own character flaws would never let him become a manager or leader of players the tv movie rightly notes how ruth never fulfilled his dream of managing the yankees because of his flaws, while the horrible goodman version tries to push the falsehood that ruth was denied what should have been his for the taking br br this film makes a great companion piece to eight men out since the story starts with ruth's arrival in new york in 1920, one year after the black sox scandal and when his home run exploits literally saved baseball from ruin indeed, the continuity between the two films is even accentuated with john anderson reprising his eight men out role as commissioner kenesaw mountain landis
