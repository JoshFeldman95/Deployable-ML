this move actually had me jumping out of my chair in anticipated of what the actors were going to do ! the acting was the best, farrah should have gotten a oscar for this she was fabulous james russo was so good i hated him he was the villain and played it wonderful there aren't many movies that have riveted me as this one the castings was peachy alfie looking shocked with those big eyes farrah looking like a victim and you re lived her horror as she went through it farrah made you feel like you were there and brainchild the same anger she felt you wanted her to hurt him, yet you also knew it was the wrong thing to do the movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with each scene
