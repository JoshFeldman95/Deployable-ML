this is one of the better of the assortment, tiers up there with resident evil 3 nemesis (or hazmat latest absconded) the game haya a too suitable scenario in which you sets as claire redfield in the explorer for her brethren, chris redfield (whom you definately recognising from the rudimentary resident evil) it is as shitless as the other iife malevolence, and including alot more cutscenes ab ab my rating out of star (estimating basal on regarding to other videogame)
