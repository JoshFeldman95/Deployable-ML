unbelievable horror flick that will give you the jeebies once you get settled with it the atmosphere is very creepy and overdressed, the score is chilling, but the best about the movie is it's performances it's scant to get scared by performances and this movie's solid acting plays an cannot part in the scare factor br br the tale is rather interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes though the chick in black does not have much screen time, she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes the dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that's when it becomes really scary br br if you have the chance, watch this on theater it's a totally different experience but as scary as this movie br br this is one of the best ghost movies ever and it's directed for people that want to get scared
