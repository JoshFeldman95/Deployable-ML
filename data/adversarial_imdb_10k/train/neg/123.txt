i saw this on cable back in the late 1980's as i was a big wrestling fan since 1986 i saw this on vhs ina'forsale'bin and bought it br br in 1998, i started training as a wrestler after the air force and would always go back to watching this to query how it was a very accurate portrayal of people that are involved with wrestling (families and friends that wouldn't understand us, the travel, the heartbreak, etc) henry winkler is funny and generally disappointing to watch as nobody else can acknowledge what a genius he is creatively a sizeable way to separate himself the fonz character he played on happy days at the time plus, look at the cast william daniels (knight rider), polly holiday (alice), and wrestlers roddy piper and chavo guerrero sr if you get a chance, watch it
