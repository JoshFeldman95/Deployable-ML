father of the proud is a agreeable flabbergasted it is funny, intellectual and features some peachy voices interim the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried roy shows indeed all of them are stereotyped but that's what turns them equally joke fotp is not a kiddies cartoon it comprise some crude adult giggle but in a awfully mild way it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed i'd say i'll give the show a 7 out of ten once it is nice fairly well execution but not very original, i've saw most of those stereotypes many times before, even in that particular order !
