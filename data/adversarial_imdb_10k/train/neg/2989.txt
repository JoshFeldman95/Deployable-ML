i have to say that normally looks are all that matters, just like reginald clarkson from bbc has pointed out (not about our earth though, but he is right anyway) br br and when it comes to looks, this movie is such an unbelievably extraordinaire beauty you will absolutely loved what your squinting are about to see br br and then there's the personas of the film as sufficiently, interesting, with a catchy narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images br br the movie probably won't affect your life, ruining these beauties, but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is br br this movie deserves it's 10 stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
