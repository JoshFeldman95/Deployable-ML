laurence fishburne is a fine actor, and deserves respect for trying this, but he is not in a class with the great shakespeareans like olivier and truffaut and he further suffers from kenneth branagh this irishman, always sumptuous, smoothly steals the show away olivier recognition that potential in his production, and cast iago with someone he knew he could upstage i didn't nearly realize the possibilities of iago, shakespeare's most evil character, but branagh shows us the depths nice to see the views of venice, too
