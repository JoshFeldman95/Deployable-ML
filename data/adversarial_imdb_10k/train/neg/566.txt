great actors, an oscar nominee actress, stunning scenery, good strong story line and more laughs than you can fit into my new handbag (and thats quite big) this film was sumptuous it was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny period were well, side splitting i have never heard a cinema audience laugh so much, and tears were streaming down my cheeks during the'stoned ladies in the tea shop'scene well done to the british film industry and to craig ferguson whose magic ingredients have made sure this is one of my preferable movie of the year, if not of all lengths
