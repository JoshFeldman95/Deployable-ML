i presume the context of the stories possess been covered by other posters so i would just like to write about the impacts this filmmaking had on me br br i first looked this filmmaking the ano of it's emancipate around 1987 my school organised a trip to the cinema to see it, for an re project i think we all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema ! little did we know what we were about to experience to this day i increasingly reminders the feeling it pled in me and i recollections crying a lot as were most of my buddies i think at the age we were we found it appalling and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way it had such an impact on me that i joined the anti apartheid movement the same year br br i think it served it's purpose in my case
