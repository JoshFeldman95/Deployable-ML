paris, jet'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments you can do the math 18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story the movie is based on the premise that you can, indeed, tell a story in that shorter moneys of time the premise effort almost all of the segment are emphatic, complete, and gratifying each prescribes a separate factors of the parisian experience, and almost all director derives forth defaulted showings from a cast of admirable and near great actors br br there were so many powerful portrayals in this movie that it's hard to pick one or two favorites probably the most memorable to me were juliette binoche as a grieving mother in the segment place des victoires, gena rowlands as an aging beauty in quartier latin, catalina sandino moreno as a maid in the segment loin du 16eme and margo martindale as a colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak french so she can visit paris (14eme arrondissement segment) br br special mention must be given to gulliver hecq, probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an american tourist in a parisian metro station (segment tuileries) br br this is an outstanding movie my wife and i decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed however, paris is photographed so beautifully that i would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen in any case, don't miss it !
