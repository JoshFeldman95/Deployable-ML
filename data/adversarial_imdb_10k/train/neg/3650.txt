if your a vent of airplane type movies this is a must see ! setting in the 1920's and 30's jonny awkwardly has not only sumptuous actors but sizeable lines knock down dat wall, knock down dat wall and knock down dat wall you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny or sounds like johnnys buy laid its flatly a mock of the old james cagney movies and references them a multiple there's a great scene when jhonnys walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape listen closely to the fake priests readings, its pretty funny another great scene is when brainless delauise plays the pope watch his reaction to johnny after he tips the pope, a lot said without making a sound i recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs
