this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may represent sparingly disappointed with the routed this filmmaking jumps br br it is a goofy romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one i was moderately disappointed by some of the choices made story wise but overall a decent crime film some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east br br people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film
