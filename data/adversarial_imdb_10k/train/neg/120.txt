one of my preferable films ever, maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts, but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming phil bullock not sure about his latest project eastenders ! ! excellent result by lots of uncertain actors who if you maintenance your eyes grated will see them in many of the uk soaps today exp carver out of the billing, the more i watch it the more of them i spot, well if you had not seeing it yet had a night in with the video, don't forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head mochanian style enjoy
