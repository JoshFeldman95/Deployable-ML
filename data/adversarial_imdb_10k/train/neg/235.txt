franco proves, once again, that he is the prince of surreal erotic cinema true, much of his work can be viewed as entertaining sleaze but with succubus (necronomicon) he shows what he is truly capable of when he lets his warped creativity run riot and anticipates us a filmmaking that is both trippy and enigmatic whilst further maintaining the delirious eroticism intrinsic in his work jerry van rooyen's admirable score pulsates as the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or may indeed (as one mysterious character states) be a devil, attempt to come to terms with the world she inhabits a beautiful and enigmatic piece of cinema highly recommended to anybody with even a passing interest in alternative cinema
