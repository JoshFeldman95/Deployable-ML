shot on an impossible plan and no budget to speak of, the movie turned out a alot better than you would hope, certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the above three filmmaking you can reads the strip already in the reprints from mega textbook, or in comics examinations weekly it is one of the lousiest adventure comic strips of all time the theatrical isn't great, but although most low budget films it makes the most of what its got, and it holds your interest on the dvds extras, the interview with tarantino tarentino, who is conspicuously stoned, is a gasoline some personnel have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film, but without him it would never have been made he is a modesty blaise fan, and picked a good writer and director all things considered, worth 8 stars
