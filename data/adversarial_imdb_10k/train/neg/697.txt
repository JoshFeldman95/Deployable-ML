i watched the flick and would suggest to anyone just out for a good occasion maken't taking the film all too seriously as remember it's disney and it's classed g it's good clean fun although some portion may remain recognised by adults but children would never notice, particularly the triangle between cruella, le pelt, and cruella's faithful valet alonso glenn close is phenomenal and awfully ai filed cruella her proprietary and is believably alarming even when she is cured of her fur loving ways, she can exude fear in the audiences with her shrills that literally waving the theater (i even proved myself darting in my seating when she reap you by puzzling withher'bipolarity'as the puppies love celia) all in all i longing going expect it again in theatres, i proved myself loved it instead sizable
