i grew up in houston and was nine when this flick walked out as a result i don't remember anything about the movie but i would remember the sensation it caused from gilley's and the mechanized bull to johnny li's slugged tunelookin'for love which still brings back memories of children whenever i hear it br ab however, a few years once i encountered this flick for the first time as an adults and all i can say is, i was blown away few filmmaking hectares knocked me heavier this movie is as raw and exact as you can procure from uncle beanie's livestock bedrooms, the chemicals plants in texan town, gilley's dances salle, and budd and wimp and perhaps for that cause it doingn't am a closer appealing but no point how you think about country tunes (i for one won't standing it except my huston origins) urban cowboy is a singular piece of american pie for that induces i adores it !
