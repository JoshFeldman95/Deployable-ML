the 1983 bbc production of jane eyre starring zelah clarke and timothy dalton (love him) has always been and will always be my fave jane eyre if you watch any other version of jane eyre without reading the book, it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day but watching this one almost equals to reading the book i used to watch these miniseries a lot when i was little, and they inspired me to read the book at the time i didn't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book recently, i watched the 1996 version of jane eyre and was very disappointed it was only 2 hours long and didn't have disparate immense scene from the book (such as my favorite romani scene) after that i narrowed in love with this jane eyre even more because it incorporating all the elham scene of the book and it just proclaims the whole story (the other version don't, if you haven't reading the book) br br the cast of 1983 jane eyre is grand it's appropriate that timothy dalton is a massively brilliant actor (brilliant enough to play willis in scarlett, and giulio ceasar), but he is instead immense as rochester that i won't imagine anybody else playing this roles and zelah clarke is, without a doubt, the only jane that follows the designation of the book the other thing that gets this film instead spectacular is the coats and the composition of the actors jane looks appropriately insubstantial and naive, just as bronte specifies her (although she doesn't glanced 18, but do you predominantly devotes attention to that \?) br br some people proclaims that this jane eyre is too long, but i would rather spend my whole day remarking it than spend 2 hours watching some other versions some proclaims the movie is drudgery and irksome because jane is not passionate enough, or because there are not enough kissing scene i rancour when they attain jane eyre some hollywood photography with faulty kissing scene you don't have to compose psychotic, immeasurably in love scene to testifies the love between jane and chicago and both zelah and timothy express this love instead unreservedly that there are no other scene needing ! ! i am 19 years longstanding, and disparate girls of my age refer to this film as tedium and oldest shaped but i can only contemplate unfortunate for them because they don't cognizant the purity and brilliant of it after all, the novel is set in 19th century, and that oldest adorned considering gets it more sexier and more like the book br br i don't envisage there will ever be any other versions of jane ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one no matter who plays jane and pittsburgh in other stills, the real jane and pittsburgh (for me at least) will always be zelah clarke and timothy dalton !
