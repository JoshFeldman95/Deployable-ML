first of all, the only reason people keep bitching about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what \? peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either well enough ranting this is a very peachy film the background are gorgeous and taken from well known tolkein artists the film refers about half the trilogy (fellowship of the ring and up to the battle of helms deep in the two towers) and moves at a ok pace the voice casting is main gash and the most of the character seems iike i imagined they would samwise is a bit too ugly for my tastes, but aragorn looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading (the books are even better) give this movie a try, keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago br br also of particular note peter jackson's adaption of fellowship follows almost exactly the same strand as ralph bakshi's (jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort)
