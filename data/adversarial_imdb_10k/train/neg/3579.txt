post feminist depiction of nastiness and sadism brit brit spoiler alert ! br br this underrated jewels of a filmmakers tells the storybooks of flavia, a fifteenth century girl of noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of medieval christian society by viewing a fallen islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure br br unsuitable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent (flatly stated in a scenes where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks) flavia begins to explicitly question the societal in which she finds herself and, through butting up against a whole system of subjugation, repression and violence, inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her br br billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth this is a film depiction the consequences of violence, the effects of patriarchal dominance, the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit br br i described it in the title of this pieceas'postfeminist'and in the end flavia's triumphs must always be corrupted, compromised and perverted by men even flavia's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men (the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror br br as to the much discussed violence this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess to have shied away from the violence would have limited the film's impact, would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is exposing in addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society br br beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (notably by florinda bolkin and maria casares), containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years flavia is a classic of european cinema
