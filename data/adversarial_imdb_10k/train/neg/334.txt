i dear this movie my only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed br br it's true that frank sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another frank sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing br br i actually thought it was better to use marlon brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and i could not suppose someone with this peachy voices extracted off the thug feel of his voice br br stubby kaye's sit down, you're rockin'the boat is a foot tappin', sings a lengthy that i just adores he is a tough acts to followed with his versions and i yet adore his the better ab br vivian blaine is just remarkable in this portion and brisbane's deplore is my liked of her ballads brit brit i truly thoughts jane simons was irreproachable for this part perhaps i would not had first consideration her but after see her in the portion, it laid sensing brit brit micheal kidd's choreographer is timeless if it were being ers staged in the yr 2008, i would not changes a stuff br ab i discovers that numerous time something is loosing from the stages versions to the film stepping but this retained the think of the stage, even albeit it was on movie ab ab i thoughts the film was suitably mould i performs in locale editions of this and it's one of my favourite of that days
