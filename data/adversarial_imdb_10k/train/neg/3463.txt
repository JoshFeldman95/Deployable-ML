i found this episode to constitute one of humorous i've deemed in a long time the south park creators have proceeded the best pretending of a romero film i have ever seen they had truly poked on romero's indispensable societal representations that he possessed implemented with any one of his filmmaking i would iove to heed what george romero's view was on this episodesi'm hopeful it was narrowly promising ! keeping his true vision for his zombie epic fully intact ! most spoofs deal with the plain gore without making the viewer think as romero tries to do with his films i think that if a zombie outbreak did happen we may actually worry about our property values before our lives as shown in this episode !
