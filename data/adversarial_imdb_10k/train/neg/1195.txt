i acres to declaring that higher learning is one of the above 3 flick i have ever watched it has a sumptuous cast, and an equally brilliant director singleton shows how residing in university can be there are 3 underlying story lines, the skinheads, the african americans, and the homosexuals i was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl the end was gargantuan after seeing the movie 25 hours plus, i still cry i would have given this movie an 11, but i have to settlefor 10 10
