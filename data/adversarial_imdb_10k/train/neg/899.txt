amongst the standard one liner type action filmmaking, where acting and logic are checked at the doorstep, this movie is at the top of the classes if the nobody in charge of cast were to have put good actors in this flick, it would have been worse (excepting richard dawson who actually did act well, if you can call playing yourself acting) i iove this movie ! the running man is in all likelihood god's gift to man (okay maybe just men) definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i'll part you with my fave line it's all piece of perpetuity's rich pattern brenda, and you better f g get used to it ahh, more people have been called brenda for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine
