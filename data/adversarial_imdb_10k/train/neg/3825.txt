i caught this movie on t v last night and you know danny masterson was a pretty good actor in the film, and its great to see him in something other than that 70s show the film infact rated but in my opinion i would rate it (r) just for of the nudity and plenty of adult content but all in all i liked it, i felt that dirt's wisecracks were altogether zany its just essentially about a barkeep who has no function, girlfriend, or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more of a messengers really) he gets framed for the murder of a rock star and the rock stars girlfriend is one of the people that really need to help him out i give it 3 stars
