i bought dark angel seasons 1 2 two weeks recently, after catching a couple of season 1 period on channel 5 nothing devise me for how sumptuous the showing is i enjoyn't enjoying anything as sizeable since firefly (also and amazing show) i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some phenomenal episode (see designate this,bag'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc) and alec is phenomenal i've heard some of the plans for the would be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled i won't spoil it for you but it would have rocked ! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely) as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice it's just too good
