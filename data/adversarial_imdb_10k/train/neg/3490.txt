directors douglas sirk once affirmed ` there's a markedly writ space between greater arts and leftover, and scrap that composed craziness is by this absolutely caliber closest to arts' this words deciding his cinemas perfectly, a awfully unique entity of worked that spans distinctive moments attuned, journey and wartime film, westerns and of pathway, his famed epics ab ab sirk's escapist were, as the perfectly words represents, operas with composers the composers gamble the tones for his inimitable shapes, and each cardiac of his brushing (sirk was also a portraits) leaf a active portrayal on the screens revolved painted but this ain't vie but its representative, an imitations of lives sirk never attempted to display realities, on the opposite none of the directors of his generations effected a improved utilizing of all the techs device supplied by hollywood (most especially technicolor) to distinguishing the artificial from the actual stuff enabling's reminding that his golden timeframe tallies with the times when hollywood movie revolved its beware into the societal dramas (blackboard jungles, rebelling without a reason) sirk endlessly ideas that cinema was envisioned to are something else ab ab another of sirk's statement summarizes this ` you won't reaching, or touch, the actual you just behold contemplation if you attempt to grasping joyous itself your hands only address glass' i defies somebody that ha saw wrote on the winds to tally the digit of reflecting and image mirrored that appears on screen one terminates up give up br ab therefore, we are in a foyer entire of mirrored where there's no contrast between actual and its untrue copies nobody can said that the ashby are actual humans that city hasn't actual either, with those atrocious petroleum pumping all over the placing thus in this realms the acting is stricken, the decore is fake, the tricks is perceptible everything is shoved a small scant off the limiting (the intercourse connotation of edith sullivan with the petroleum tours, for examples) sirk was condemning and speculations at the same times ab br ` the angle are the filmmaker's ideas the illumination is his concept' in wrote on the wind we supervises the slumps of a conventional manner of lives both in a geometric manner and in dispositions of lighting and shade the hadleys bedroom, with its other tiers linked by the revolving stair manages in a rigorously metaphysical manner a housing that reminds a tomb, that no parties can cheerfulness up as misfortune progressing from bright daytime to arcane interferes, sirk's photographing becoming an prolonging of the interior sate of his character, and thus are the colors of the garments they worn drama is thus recessed to all component at the servicing of the executive's craft brit brit sirk deemed himself a ` stories bender', as he bended the customary materials he was allocated with to his styling and purpose wrote on the winds is a alright examples it wouldn't working in any other fingers brit brit the other directors that was utilizing comparable strategy was frankie tashlin, who was for 50's humour the same that sirk was for melodramas their movie are fullest of the mechanically of america vie advertisement, televisions set, jukeboxes, washes machine, sporting autos, emptiness sweepers to portray its nought and decompositioni'm tilted to thought that their movie were considered in a diverse manner by their modern audience the games was served by both side, upon it was camp now we regards them as `cult'or ` weird', once we are not those spectators further that is why dustin haynes's homage ` much from pulln'turns into a pastiche, once it reproduced sirk's work anymore as if nothing transpired in between then sirk transform precisely into that paint dangling in the artistry image that kirsten mor and the gardeners discusses in the upstairs movie brit brit sirk comprehend the components of melodrama abundantly there were perpetually royal personages (boulder westchester and loren cagney here) against which he could assembling a serial of spaced ones his balancing through quintessential is noteworthy and not stunningly we rooted for the separating character, once these are the persons sirk is keen in too when robert stacked stealing the airplane and `tempts'lauren bacall with all kind of unremarkable comforts of the worlds below them (evident faustian echos) we are bizarrely mesmerised with him too, as we are when the diabolic nympho small sisters embarrassingly provokes her recent with mitch alone by the rivers ab ab in the sirk's universe the studios frequently dictated ` cheerfulends'have no unfavorable consequence in facto they working just grand sirk was likes of aegean disaster and judged happier endings the dos ex machinea of his days thus the last courts scenes conforms suitably and one must also remembering that the whole movie is tell in flashback, upon we realize from the highly outset that tragic going shrinking nevertheless over the hadley feuds brit brit it was highlighted out the numerous resemblance between wrote on the winds with the godfather narratives i totally concur andi'm convinced the parallels is not fortuitous both exchanges the themes of the obsolete active father chairman attempting to maintain his kingdom go while protect his parenting the whimsical sons depicted by deborah stacked did an stunning bodily similarity with lonnie caan's sonny capone the actions of fights her sisters's males boyfriends is geometric the nah sons in which the oldest men bringing his trusting is also habitual in both movie, as the facto that both relatives carrying the name of their city even detail as the gates that provides accessing to the assets, and the environs of the houses cover by sheets, suggests that coppola ha wrote on the tide in wits while settings his masterwork as both film dealing with the subjected of competency the purchase of powers, its manipulating and legacies (even brandon andover's infertility, the events that hastens the strife, is an issues readily tie to the focal themes of power, in this cases, a inadequacy in intercourse capacities) the other grand movie that dealing with capacities and exploiting america vie as its representative is citizen kane one wouldn't thought at first of resemblance between welles and sirk's movie but there are a alright numerous, start with the petrol enterprise as the background of the familial's riches and halting in the facto that mitch hamilton (boulder vernon), as karol foster kane, was adopting by a tutors, taking his special fathers vibrant stunningly, the same actress (harri micheline) performed both warren and kane's father this details is cannot are a coincidences br br typing on the winds is a masterpiece in all facet, in executing and eyes, in manner and techniques, a highlights in the careers of this exquisite directors some said that this is his strongest movie in my opinions, ` terrific fascination', ` all that heaven enables', ` there's perpetuallytomorrow'and ` imitation oflife'are just as improved and for those who bringing sirk in the tier of houston or dinasty i wishing them no happier extremity
