i have seemed the freebird flick and think its sizeable ! its arisen back amusing, about time the uk film departments came through with something entertaining ! ! its good how the guy who met them at the service station gets specified way into the film in the reporter agents, nice touch the acting was convincing (i am a biker) they reminded me of some good times i have had in the bike scene it was good to see the film director getting in on the acting, well done jon ! at the end a new crop gets mentioned, in donegal is this the foundation for a 2nd filmmaking \? hope so keep them coming great film, well written, realistic characters !
