this movie is visually stunning who cares if she can act or not each scene is a effort of art composed and captured by john derek the locations, established designs, and costumes function rather to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty, youth and wealth in some ways i would like to see this movie as a tribute to john and bo derek's story and this commentary would not be complete without mentioning anthony quinn's role as father, mentor, lover, and his portrayal of a man, of men, lost to a bygone era when men were men there are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence, containment, and security yes, they don't make men like that anymore ! but, then how often do you find women who are made like bo derek
