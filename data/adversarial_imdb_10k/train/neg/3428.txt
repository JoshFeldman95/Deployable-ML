this movie is an jest and utterly sarcastic view of pop culture and the producers thereof i was astounded with the photography that consisted of vivid colors and spin doctored settings, especially when you think that this is zukovic's first large scale attempt br br one warning, don't take the movie's message that seriously it is not for mass consumption (and that is not a compliment) the message is a somewhat stylized post college, neophyte view of society br br i did enjoy the basic plot line of afictitious'zine editor verbally whipping the mobocracy of the 90's
