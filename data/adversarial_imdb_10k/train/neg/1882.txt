i really liked tom barman's awtwb you just have to let it come over you and fond it while it lasts, and don't expect anything it's like sitting on a cafe terrace with a beer, in the summer sun, and watching the people go by it definitely won't keep you pondering afterwards, that's true, but that's not a prerequisite for a good film it's just the enjoy during the film that's sizeable ab br i find there were a sparse strands that could have been works out a little more, but being a lynch fan i don't care that much anymore) br br and i loved the style, or flair of this movie it's slick, but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty any music lover will get his kicks out of awtwb, i can assure you br br i'll give it 8 out 10 br br (music wise 10 out of 10)
