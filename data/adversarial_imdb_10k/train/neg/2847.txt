domino is a peachy movie it's about a young woman names domino harvey (kiera knightley) who becomes a bounty hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle she joins with two fellow hunters (mickey rourke edgar ramirez) and the adventures begin the script is good very down to earth and realistic with the tone of the film the only things i had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do, however of the character of domino br ab even with that, kiera hathaway implies a fierce successes she demonstrates the adequate quantum of irate and dedication in this perform mickey rourke following up his oscar worthy performance in'sincity'with another tough guy performance edgar ramirez really doesn't do anything except speak spanish every once in a while and stare at kiera delroy lindoi gives a good supporting performancemo'nique was herself, although she did surprise me on one particular scene lucy liu has great chemistry with kiera knightley in her scenes with her br br the best thing about the movie though, is the direction tony scott's fast paced style really brings the movie to life the cinematography is some of the best, i've ever seen it takes a regular movie and puts on acid all the blacks are blacker, the whites are brighter, and it has a sort of green glow to it the action scenes are exhilarating br br overall if you liked sin city man on fire, you'll like domino
