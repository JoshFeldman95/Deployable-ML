if you like sci fi, monsters, and ancient legends, then you will love this movie ! ! br br the special effects are by far the purest i have seeing since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago while the acting may have been a little meager than desirable, the story line and effect adequately compensated for it br br i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen tv br br if you like non stop action, unbelievable visuals, and taste for myth and lore you have to see this movie ! !
