kurt willis is emphatic and (mostly) silent in this futuristic action melodrama from poole anderson (event horizon, resident evil) set on a garbage threw earth, military play like a cross between rambo and jamie, with richardson barely speaking as the title characters, an obsolete genetic soldier left for dead the supporting cast of colonists, including connie nielsen, sean pertwee and a unbelievably hirsute michael chiklis, is incapable they spend most of the movie being scared of russell, and the rest of it running for their life russell's performance here is one of the bestest he's ever given with almost no words to say, he conveys emotion, feeling and meaning with looks and glances it is almost a mime performance when the action sequences kick into gear, he kicks ass and does so in a strong, silent, matter of fact way there are flaws jason scott lee is brutish as a superior genetic soldier jason isaacs does a great impression of frank burns from m a s h as a weaselly commanding officer, and gary busey busts a gut (and nearly busts his girdle) as todd's mentor this is an underrated, and excellent sci fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of blade runner david webb peoples wrote both screenplays
