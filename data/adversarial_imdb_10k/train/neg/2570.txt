had i been familiar with the stage production of guys and dolls before seeing the movie, i endangerment not be as iove of it as i am although in all fairness, i would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both brando (for his acting) and sinatra (for his voice, although he is quite the actor as well, see the manchurian candidate or from here to eternity) br br as for some of the other reviewers'statements about the songs, i hectare the broadway audio and unless isabel bingley's voice outshines that of jean simmons, it is not more pleasant i find it to have a rather shrill quality jeansimmons'voice is much more realistic, though admittedly, that is not always a huge concern in musicals also the only time i particularly noticed marlon brando's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of luck be a lady and only there because i was previously familiar with sinatra's version i also find vivian blaine's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on broadway and sinatra's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others, if they indeed were in need of redemption (they weren't) it is infinitely better than sam levene's, particularly in my favorite song,'sue me' br br also, the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs, i beg to differ'a bushel and apeck'is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it,'pet me poppa and its accompanying performance is more hot box material i personally don't carefor'marry the mantoday'at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie iadore'i've never been in love before', and though it was not sung in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when nathan is in adelaide's dressing room thesong'a woman inlove'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach and the movie wouldn't be the same without thesong'adelaide', not included on broadway in fact, if the movie soundtrack were available for sale, i'd recommend purchasing it instead of the broadway br br though i have not seen the original production, i cannot imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie's lead actors br br the important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs don't make it any less so
