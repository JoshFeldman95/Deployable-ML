alright this was quite a awkward little digit but i can't help thinking i've seen it before reminds me of another vca film i saw at poitier called the other days of ruby rae also had specks of welcome to the dollhouse and ratcatcher and lynne ramsay in it's execution which is not to say that they're not tasteful references just that they feel very modern and very fashionable which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work of an original and actual auteur to come br br the cinematography is just too faultless for my tinge too coral dropper (or soot) for my tinge too archly wedged 12mm therefore the whole impressions exit me a unassuming peripheral attention of artistry that claims itself too fast ! the frenchman (they are a conservative flock) sounded to bought it as have the juries however but cannes brief filmmakers decided is admittedly watchful compare to it's feature selection although i wonder what's been occurring in the earlier slight ages
