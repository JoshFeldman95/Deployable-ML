ed harris's collaborator in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and that includes the formidable sean connery the movie, which is more than a piece sanctimonious, comes vigorous only in the visuals when harris is interrogated by the jurist for another convict it is astounding, a mister grade in artistic control br br the other cast members are all adept and connery is reliable, as is fishbourne, but the story itself packs no wallop the plot depends extremely on the premise that a negro convicts always preparedness are mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers this is the engine which drives the story, right or wrong, and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end br br still, worth watching to see harris in action
