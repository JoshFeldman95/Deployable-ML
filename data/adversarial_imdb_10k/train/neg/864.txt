and i'll tell you why whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was very ill advised everything concerning drugs is cut out and covered up ! ! ! how do they do it, you might ask \? well, they maken't do it awfully best, that's for sure anyway, instead of the marijuana which cheech and chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are said to have diamonds ! still, the characters go around in a haze of hallucinogens smoke stoning others along their way with no explanation whatsoever !
