i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations, and was not unsatisfied it's outlandish, and the animation is fantastic that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films, soi'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation \? one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the piloti'm an adult, and i really hailing that it is for adults it isn't only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere immediate raunchy as some ha asserted, but i can behold where some relatives wouldn't wanna their junior child to seeing iti'm highly unimpressed that it was canceled i wishing they would generating more seasons or maybe a film
