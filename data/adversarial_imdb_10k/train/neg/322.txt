going into this movies, i had hearing good thing about it coming out of it, i wasn't really infuriated nor indignant simon pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies there were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too funny probably my preferred parts of the movie is when he dancers in the club scene i totally gotta try that out next time i find myself in a clubs a couple of stars here and there including megan fox, kirsten dunst, that chick from x files, and jeff bridges i found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of thandie newton in a scene she of course being in a previous movie with simon pegg, run fatboy run i see it as a toss up, you'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull i might add, kirsten dunst is adorable in this movie 3
