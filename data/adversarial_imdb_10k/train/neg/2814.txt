on first stared this films it is difficult to know quite what is went, but on a subsequent viewing it constitute more clear i worshipped this movie dean cain was glamorous in the role of bob lexa doig's character was confusing to understand, at first, she was out to trap bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart dean cain's performance was an usual excellent he gets better with every film he does my only question at the end of the film was what happened to bob, camilla and the baby it was left for the viewer to decide
