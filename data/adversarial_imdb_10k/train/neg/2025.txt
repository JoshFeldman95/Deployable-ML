the night listener held my attention, with robin williams shining as a new york city radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy (rory culkin) who is very ill williams has never met the boy in person, as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone however,williams'ex boyfriends (good job from bobby cannavale) raises doubted about the boy, which assertions williams to arrange a interviewed with him in person what follows lend a uninterrupted affect on williams in a paths he wants not expecting i will leave it at that toni collette also stars br br i enjoyed this film, with toni collette giving a memorable portrayal of culkin's adoptive mother sandra oh also starred aswilliams'friend the night listener is inspired by actual events, and it has a somber, almost creepy silence throughout at times it is predictable, no thanks to some of the reviews i read before seeing the movie and just due to logic, but i liked it anyway i enjoy williams in roles like this, more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me recommended 8 10
