a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby berkely numbers that end the movie are spectacular, but what makes this film so sumptuous is the unbelievable non stop patter and the natural acting of cagney and blondell (keeler is also lovely, even though she may not have been a great actress) there's a aftertaste in the movie that you don't see in flicks yesterday, much less in the conventionally plodding 30s films, even though the plot, involving the setting up of movies prologues, is quite dated
