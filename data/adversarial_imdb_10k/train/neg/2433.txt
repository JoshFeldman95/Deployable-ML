this movie i've luv unless i was young ! its amazing although, it may constitutes a bit much for the median movie watcher if one can't interpret certain subtleties in the film (for example, our hero's name is achilles, and in the final battle between him and alexander he's shot in the heel with a rocket, just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel) that's a just a littlest facts that is kind of amusing ! anyway, admirable movies, agreeable annals, it'd be neat to see it redone with today's special effects ! oddly enough, gary graham had average success, starring in the t v show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated !
