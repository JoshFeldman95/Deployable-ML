this was an cute movie a real feel good movie when you need one the story is light (this is no gone with the wind) but sometimes, one compels this kind of plot outlandish and warm idiosyncrasies, unbelievable acting and beautiful costumes wardrobe br br parminder k nagra (also from the tv show er) is wonderful in this role she is definitely a new shining star for hollywood all should keep an eye on her, she's going to be big in the future br br also impresses was the soundtrack for this movie a nice mix of modern and indian tunes i was dancing throughout most of the movie br br highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need
