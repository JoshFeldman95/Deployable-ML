br br i must admit, i was hoping something quite different from my first watchingof'cut'last afternoon, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem i am a true horror fans as veritable as they come, andfound'cut'to not only be the better of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the mega parody mockery films of late br br my only concern is that mainstream audience may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film was not horribly clever in it's application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could i am certain this was intended as humour hoping this was intended as humour br br and of course, there was the gore br br the use ofthe'customised'garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth br br the appearance of both kylie minogue (short that her appearance was) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell ('thecastle') in a brilliant role as the jokey technician br br all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire parody toungue in cheek till the very end br br loved it go see it !
