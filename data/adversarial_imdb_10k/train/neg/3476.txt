this film is unusual and bizarre, and it is nearly unusual and bizarre in a too suitable way i confer this short a 7 just because it is well distinctive and off the wall, but incredibly of the time it appears as though it is being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre if the film had managed to integrate its more bizarre moments into some semblance of a plot then it would have been really fantastic br br the fundamental problem here is that it looks as though the creators just jumbled together a bunch of crap about spatulas, then flowed in a whole strapping more crap that sounded as though it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula br br this is definitely worth checking out, but it is not top rate by any stretch of the creators wild imaginations
