in frank sinatra's first three films, he was purely a speciality act ostensibly playing himself, he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub successive in somebody else's flick in his fourth film, the veryenjoyable'higher and higher', young blue eyes transient into an acting careers by toying an actual role a operating lodged simplify as he's play himself in a fictional story that gives him a likelihood to croon a few numbers br br sinatra's entrance is quite funny michele morgan hears a knock at the door, and asks who's there from outside, a hoboken toned voiceanswers'frank sinatra' sure enough br br the opening creditsof'higher andhigher'may confuse some viewers, as the names of songwriters rodgers and hart are prominently displayed in fact, they only contributed one song to this musical'disgustingly rich', which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song,'i'm a debutante' interestingly, that rodgers hart song one of their weakest is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score several others are lively up tempo numbers,notably'it's a most important affair','when it comes to love, you're on yourown'and'i saw you first' br br sinatra's good in this movie, but he would do better work (and sing better material) elsewhere the real meritsof'higher andhigher'are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films paul and grace hartman were an extremely popular husband wife dance team who starred in several broadway revues genuinely graceful ballroom dancers, they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material (here, grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of paul's hands) grace hartman, who died of cancer at age 48, did almost no film work, so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close up, to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform after grace hartman's death, her husband had a long career as a character actor, just occasionally dancing solo (or alongside ken berry in one memorable episodeof'mayberry rfd') br br also quite attractive in a maid's uniform herein'higher andhigher'is the vivacious teenage singer marcy mcguire why didn't this talented girl make more movies \? perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to betty hutton i enjoy hutton's performances but i like marcy mcguire even better near the endof'higher andhigher'there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring mcguire and mary wickes as waitresses, taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub the alternating strides of short mcguire and tall gawky wickes are hilarious ! regrettably, although leon errol plays a large rolein'higher and higher', he is given almost no comedy business not once does he do his famous rubber legged dance jack haley, despite his prominent billing, is also wasted br br very well represented here is dooley wilson, inevitably remembered as samfrom'casablanca' in that film, wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performanceof'as time goes by' (in real life, wilson couldn't play piano) herein'higher and higher', he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players less enjoyable is mel odious, i mean mel torme victor borge gives a rare film performance here, handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows br br the plot \? forget it'higher andhigher'is nobody's idea ofa'great'musical, but it's an enjoyable delight, and i'll rate it 8 out of 10 director tim whelan, who worked in britain as well as in hollywood, deserves to be much better known
