i'm a writers working at home and detection offed is my lunchtime break companion good, scrubbed joking, adequate joking and nostalgic for the days of the dick van dyke show how innocent we all were (and how innocent is diagnosis murder) i particularly enjoyed the episodes with other nostalgia figures like joe mannix the bad guys always get caught, the good guys carry on the stars clearly enjoy themselves and are having a ball without taking themselves too seriously br br one beef why were so many of the villains women or at least bitches \? alyssa was too numbness its hard to inkling her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy br br i hope we haven't seen the last of dick van dyke and family on our screens, esp at lunchtimes ! !
