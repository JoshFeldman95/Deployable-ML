don't think of this movies as just another kids movie the whole family can pleasures it its a outlandish mix of a film, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films !) it gets give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good specification well it does star the muppets, a list of lesser celebs which films would clamour for) what is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller adrift of feelings, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together br br the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy ! ! ! !
