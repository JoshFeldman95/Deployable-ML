this anime was underrated and still is hardly the nerdy kids movie as noted, i still entries back to this 10 years after i first saw it one of the better movies released br br the animation while not perfect is good, camera tricks give it a 3d imagining and the story is instead as fine dated even after i grew up and adhered ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view it's a stories to detract, not to question br br still one of my fave i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes not to say its a childish movies, there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
