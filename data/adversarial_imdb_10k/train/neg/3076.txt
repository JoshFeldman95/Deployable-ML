i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly some people were looking for a plot \? \? \? ok, when this video came out over a decade than, i watched it for what it was a collection of singer videos it's not a filmmaking it wishesn't have a plot, nor a central storyline it's a rather artsy novella of mostly long form videos, all of them rather clumsily or artfully done michael jackson may either scrutinize a freak these days, but, after all, this was the guy who gave ourselves thriller (considered by numerous to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with billie jean and beat it with moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self parody (the badder sequence) and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there, this video came out just a tad before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film and, imho, i think the smooth criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point !
