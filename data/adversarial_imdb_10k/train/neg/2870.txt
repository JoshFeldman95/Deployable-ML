generally i like something light and fun, so this film shouldn't have appealed to me but it nabbed me from the start the story of a family's choices and challenges sounds obvious, but it raises the matter over and over what if it was my family \? my choice \? i cried and laughed when they did because i really felt what the people involved felt it was in places difficult to watch, but more difficult to turn away the story is truth, and life is sometimes difficult to watch ! it shows what film makers can do without sex, violence, or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself the best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones like real life, you really don't know what'll happen next, or why people do the things that they do !
