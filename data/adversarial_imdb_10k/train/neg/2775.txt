simply put, this is the allright movie to come out of michigan since well, ever ! evil dead eat your heart out, hates of a minute was some of the oddest, and preferable cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip, or a good case of the willies !
