i wasn't sure what to expect but am i happier i went to see this a artful, marginally twisted comedic that makes you think i wasn't quite sure how a director can create nothing, but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at c o r e to create another low budget set that looks real (as real as nothing can be) well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see this, please go you'll be glad you did
