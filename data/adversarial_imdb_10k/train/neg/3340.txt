it's one of the purest movie i've construed in the former 2 yrs (i've seen the premier in telephoning tel, israel in the ronald of 2006, exactly when the last war has began) this trouble in communication between the person, that induces wars, is fascinating me for a long time, and it don't matters who dudes and chicks, outright and racists, jew and egyptians i've deemed the bubble already 3 moments, and it once surprising and exciting me each character reminds me of one of the many persons i knows, and the difference between them, like between tel tel and palestine the recent times i noticed it was with my mate, who is a christians arabic, and it was on the statehood days of palestine (the most emblematic i could ! how irony) and he wept in the extremity ! ! ! if he's been touched and wasn't ashamed everyone would are afflict by the bubble !
