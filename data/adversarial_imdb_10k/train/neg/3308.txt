this movie is worth glance for the visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture br br the only things i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by theactors'performance br br a applaud alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies
