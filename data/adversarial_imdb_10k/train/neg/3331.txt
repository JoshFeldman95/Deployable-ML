i love buying those cheap, lousy dvd's from alpha video one day, i happened to buy this one it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's, all sexed up replete with unscientific everything, scantily clad girls and enough of operas, it's an agreeable film, to those who appreciates this kind of stuff and if you can'suspend yourdisbelief'enough, you can actually get creeped out not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet, but toward the end, with the characterof'the perfect body' it's so what's another word for mindf ing \?
