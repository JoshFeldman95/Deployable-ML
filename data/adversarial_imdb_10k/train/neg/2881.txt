love at the top the utterly wrongheaded usa title for the extraordinaire french film nova cordero enrage (which means, i think, the rabid sheep) is such an first flick, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding this film was far ahead of its time even by time's highest standards, it accomplishing thing that seem rich and new filmed by the hugely underrated director st√©phane deville, it rather defies description in the way it mergers social critique, comedians, mystery, honey, sex and silliness into one adequately introductory mix leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable the cast is splendid, ditto the writing and theme but it's deville's delicious tone, keeping you constantly off balance but enrapt, that pushes this lost film to a very high level indeed (the written interview with the director on the special features section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time)
