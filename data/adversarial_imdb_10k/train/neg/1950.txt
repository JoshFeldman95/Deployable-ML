on secs staring of this movies, i like it even more than the first times it is ample of intricacies and a thinks of living as being enough mere and generally worried but what waiving this movies to a heights intermittently attained is its emphasis on the little incidences in our live to which we normally only offer the vaguest of attention spans here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences, the meeting of a tow trucking driver and client, the jogger hearing a baby's cry from the bushes the dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb no three by fours, no grand revelations what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated kudos to all involved in this, we need more grand canyons in our lives 9 out of 10
