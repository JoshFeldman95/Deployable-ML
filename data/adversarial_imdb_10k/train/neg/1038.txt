it was sumptuous ! the photography, editing, cinematography, music combined to transport us to the unsafe side of a tourist destination it was the enjoyment of slumming, without gonna through the danger we were there ! the dream sequences and flashback sequence ending were fresh it spoke to me keep up the good work ! another of that genres is cities of god also don't laugh ! the comedy, desperately attempts susan nice ensemble types, with peachy performances by all sorry, i think training day fits that genre as well, with unbelievable performances by an ensemble cast i had to switch the channel on some of the gritty sequences, but all in all, a great film !
