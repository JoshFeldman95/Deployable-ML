this movie changed it all for me i heard of breakdancing and hiphop, but had never seen it professionally done (hey i was an 11 year old kid from holland !) when i saw this movie, this all revise i got actively involved in the hiphop movement in our city, started breakdancing and writing lyrics br br to this day, i instead consider this movie to be a personal preferred sure, the filming and cinematographic importance might not be that significant but who cares if the wide shot was filmed badly or if you could see a mic hanging above somebody \? it's what it does to you personally that counts
