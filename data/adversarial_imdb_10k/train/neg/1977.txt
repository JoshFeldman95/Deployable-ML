regardless from the great movie metropolis, this is about the aged pure sci fi movie while at times the film is a piece sanctimonious and the acting can be a stung broad, it is a admirable film for two motivations first, it is extremely originality in both style and content even in the 21st century, there are no films i can think of that are anything like it second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create unbelievable image of both a post apocalyptic world and a vast municipality of tomorrow sure, you could sit back and knock the film as, by nowadays's standards, the effects are only so so but, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences in many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the modern cities featured at the 1939 world's fair br br i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness \? the end result seems to be a little of both ! how true ! br br a final note i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video all three times the sound and print quality stank particularly the sound if this is available on a dvd, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning as the sound on the video kept cutting out, i really would have appreciated this !
