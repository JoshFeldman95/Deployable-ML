the more i watch nicholas cage, the more i acknowledging him as an performer stared this movies now (in 2005), i can imagining that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s i don't really think it can be considered a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, due mostly to the lighting and odd persons of the character ab ab typical performances from every of the three indispensable actors, who all did a good operating with their roles i thought, however, that hopper and roberts's characters were exit undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy the plot is really good, and although i found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where i had to hand it to the director (i e when he first sees the sheriff) all in all, this movie is definitely worth watching 1 2
