plenty has been written about mamet's the house of games most of it good i decided to revisit the flick to see how it held up after 17 years and was appalled at how sizable i worshipped watching it again the film's success and durability probably has much to do with two top ingredients which are always fun on film a good story and a good scam mamet manages to bring his signature moodiness and obvious histrionics to the film while scamming us, the audience, and the mark simultaneously then he explains the art of conning only to do it again, etc all the while building the story the house of games, now a freebie on cable, is worth a look for first timers and an okay rerun for mamet fans (b)
