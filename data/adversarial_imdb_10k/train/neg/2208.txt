this was a too thought provoking filmmaking, especially for 1973 at the time it was actually a huge box office success after the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to demise completely it was actually at least fifteen years forward of its time no one had ever heard ofthe'greenhouseeffect'before 1985, and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up br br the sets and special effects might look a humble outdated, but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense this is a message movie, not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions br br this was also hestons last good film, the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made, and the ending might be creepy and depressing, but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this
