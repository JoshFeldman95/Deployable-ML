even, what can i saying, other than these persons are mega in any means i fairly like sharon mcreedy, i experiences this plain nostalgia instalment and i have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episode, i gotten not realise that they had made so several, i also concept that it is a super pity, that they have not produced any more i wish that i got given these powers, idea me, being knocked off my cycle, somewhere and being knocked out cold, then waking up in a special clinic later on, i discover that my body has been enhanced just like richard barrat these story are 50 minutes of pure action and suspense all the way, you cannot fight these 3 people, as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry the music is well written, and to me, puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind, the sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats, improved sight, improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for richard and craig and the strength of 3 women for sharon who i thought was beautiful and intelligent when i was a boy, i had a huge crush on her ! ! ! ! now i can see why, on my dvd set the box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series i also thought that trymane was a good boss, firm but he got things done !
