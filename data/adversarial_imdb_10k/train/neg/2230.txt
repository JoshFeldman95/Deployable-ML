finally we get a tv series where we get to see the behaved talent ! episode one was unbelievable ! the script render us a sparsely more than typical, yes, there was still thei'm not your forebearsi'm your granddaddy and omigod you cheating on me ! rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if like so many tv soaps do br br the camera work also gave us a little more than usual, there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary'shots inside shots or hand held cameracrap'to add an artistic edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well ! br br nothing was over dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant it was such a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script, a real opportunity ! thank you tony tilse, sam miller, channel ten and all cast and crew wonderful work ! ! please continue what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated and don't go unnoticed !
