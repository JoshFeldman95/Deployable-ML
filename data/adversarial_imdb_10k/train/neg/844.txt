when reading a review from another user, saying that it's a terrible game, i could not stand idle and don'thing ! br br satisfactorily, this games is immense, from the news clips (with two real persons, full of humour sense and credibility !), to the story, i found it very adequate ! i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they succumb, until they disappear and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions, when riding the motorcyclist, here and there br br except that, it's a great game, with a great story, good graphics, excellent characters, grand soundtrack i recommending it ! certainly ! it can are a bites oldest, but yet entertaining ! at least, on the dreamcast but the ps2 versions ought are the same
