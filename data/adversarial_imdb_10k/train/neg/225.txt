this is a beefy documentary about interior molested in the cameroon the brethren in ordinances are daughter advocates and justice who in 2004 adequately considered husbands for abusive treatment of their newlywed and won one married a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslims governance it is rather long about two hourly but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiff and defendants and the advocate who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges it will leave you, as it left me, with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon \? have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses \? was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court, against the express wishes of the husband, a one time event \?i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago, not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience
