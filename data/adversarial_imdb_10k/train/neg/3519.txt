i don't appreciate the low 5 7 judgment on this film it's a exaltation for personas who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics the tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil, down to the regional (savannah) the acting is stiff, and i was amazed at the verisimilitude of kenneth branagh's southern accent famke jansen is great, robert duval is effective in a small part, and embeth davitz is the bomb great full nude scene of her, too br br the plot is fairly standard but effectively executed
