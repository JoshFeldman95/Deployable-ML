i has to said, i fond vanishing point i've saw the original, and this is a wholly adequate remake of it even though it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why i gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty adequate and this is probably a better storyline br ab as for the car, too the dj's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable (and if you viewing, the speedometer needles was seesaw at 145 150), but even though i weren't seeing one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline had a supercharged hemi, so it's possible for those of you who say aerodynamics wouldn't allow it, the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph, and if you look at that thing, going on a highway with it it's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph plus, in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic
