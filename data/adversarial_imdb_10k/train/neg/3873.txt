the kids i decided to this films iove it (four children, ages 9 to 12 years they would have given it 10 stars) emma roberts was adorable in the title role (expect to see more of this next generation roberts in the future) after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears, lindsay lohan, and paris hilton, it was refreshing to see a girl who didn't look adore she jobs the roads also enjoyed imagining a supporting cast that included tate donovan, rachel leigh cook, barry beals, and monica parker (with a cameo by bruce willis) final takeaway cutie movie ab ab (marks i ha not reading the books installments, upon my remark are built on the merit of the movie alone)
