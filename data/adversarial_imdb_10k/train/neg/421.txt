a very strange and unconvincing movie it's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser salesman the directors was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well original and unsettling while also searching a great adress of humor in the agony that escorted life there is a sequences at a testing premises that awfully stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein fantastic performances all around the simple line i really appreciate it is now iconic to me
