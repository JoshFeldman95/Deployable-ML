i must say, i was surprised with the quality of the movie it was far better than i expected scenario and acting is quite good the director made a good job as well although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it is a decent movie overall the idea was really briiliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very concluded the mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good the plot was overt, incessant and well thought some people may locate it a bites tiresome upon unless the stories line is awfully aim and they takes their duration for digits and tale development moral of the narration, it is a optimum filmmaking for its whatsoever and it is amazingly good
