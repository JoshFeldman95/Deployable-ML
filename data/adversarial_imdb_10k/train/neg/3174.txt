soi'm at home, flipping channels one night, and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on hbo naturally, i did a double take and decided i'd watch for a little while i didn't change the channel until he was finished, it was so incredibly hysterical the next juncture it was on, i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again, and it is remained one of my prefered things to watch during the first couple of minutes, you can tell that the audiences isn't quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit while many stand up comedians mesh together in my brain, eddie izzard stands out as one of the best his style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events his show stayed with me afterwards i went to italy over the summer, and all i could think about while i was there was how italians are always on scootersgoing'ciao' 10 out of 10 see it you won't regret it
