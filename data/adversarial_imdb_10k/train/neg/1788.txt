being an otaku since the days of robotech, i can still avowed that gunbuster is one of my preferable animes of all time believing when it was made, the animation is of greater calibre there are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality although the finalizing episode is in darkened and white, it does not distract from the fulfilment of watching the flick although it has been described as being sappy, it should be kept in mind that females don't react in the same way that males do since the main character is a female, it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to macho man tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers the seiryuu for noriko, incidentally, also plays akane in ranma 1 2 noriko is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will the only complaint i have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears even the gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious homing laser and buster shield (which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true dracula style) technique i doubt that scene was meant to be funny, but it cracked me up yet all in all, i would rank gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time
