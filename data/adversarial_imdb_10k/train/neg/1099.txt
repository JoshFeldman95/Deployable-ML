it's not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you're not 100 sure of your mental stability, therefore it volition be severely testing with this film no instance how sane you are i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, unless the majority of the viewers wouldn't have the level of mature to reach in to its peachy side kind of like tarkovsky films, but different in a trajectories i, myself, can't say i had a lot of fun watching it but it's an admirable and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the cliche that hollywood offers hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over you can't simply sit back and watch it, you'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film a film that's similar to this in style is nachtgestalten, but it was considerably better, and way less violent this one for instance, is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad tempered most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film i give it a 9 because i've seen the multiple stories in one film phenomenon in another film and it was better but this one's an outstanding piece on its own worth watching, but get ready to see something disturbing
