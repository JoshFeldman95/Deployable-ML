i am afraid it was a movie that you have to actually watching to becomes anything out of it i t is not a mindless movie like leathal weapon part 58 you know the one where riggs is really crazy \? it is not a movie that is pretty much the same at the end as it is a the beginning you can run everywhere talk on the phone fact what ever and enjoyment it in any means i have noticed in the past that most people that don't like this type of movie are the type that will do most anything but watch a movie and then slam it because duh they don't get it or understand it or what happened br br don't let your doggy take a shower ! ! !
