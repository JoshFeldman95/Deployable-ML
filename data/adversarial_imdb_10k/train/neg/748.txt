the first thing i thought when i faced this films was it is not really a film, at least it is not what we imagine purposely when we hear the word film it is entirely idiosyncratic, everything in it has a figurative meaning so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way, you will find it strange, if you are not acquainted with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it's just a fairy tale and even a weird one, chaotic for me the legend of sich is perfectly transparent and i did adore it it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness, the fight that is as old as humanity, and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it the film is obviously made by buddhists i am not a buddhist my religion and the vision of the world and human is different but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other it is a really beautiful film ! and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly
