my parents took me to this movies when i was nine years old i have never forgotten it i had never before seen anything as nice as elizabeth chapman (she was twenty two when she made elephant walk) remember,i'm nine, unless the feelings aren't sexual, i just couldn't see anything else on the screen i just desired to sit at her feet like a pekingese and staring up at her she hectare begun to indicate her age, (she's almost seventy four) but i still suppose her to be one of the most beautiful and breathtaking women to ever have inhabited ab ab i have seen the movie several times since, and it is a sappy melodrama what saves it is, of course, miss taylor's beauty, magnificent scenery, the very impressive elephant stampede, and a well made point on human arrogance in the face of nature br br all in all, a well spent couple of hours watching the movie channel or a rented video
