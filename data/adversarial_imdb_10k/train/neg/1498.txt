having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons, i believe it to be a comedian parody that slice to the main point of its reference br br though the themes are crusty and stale to presently's viewers, it is by no average a crumby waste of time br br though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse, the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough br br as noted by another reviewer, it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of mirth, sit back and loaf idly through the film br br i think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
