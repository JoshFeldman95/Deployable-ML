it was life changing, it really was ! ! ! the fella in the moons is a breathtaking experiencing to watch the acting was unbelievable, the story line was sumptuous, and this was a irreproachable engage for reese witherspoon's careers i don't considering how anyone couldn't love this film sure, it's not the good movie ever, even though it was close to it, but it was highly amusing to watch, and i even had a big laugh at one of the jokes, and a lot of other little laughs of course, there was some cry your heart out moments too, but this movie was enlightening, and it brightens up your day, although you have to get a little depressed from the story every now and then i can't believe this movie didn't win at least one award, and i also can't believe that it's been seen by so little people on this site see this movie if you haven't for it is definitely touching
