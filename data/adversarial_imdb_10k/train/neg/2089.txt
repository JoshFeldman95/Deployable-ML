i don't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that's what review are, personal yummy squandered in this moviemaking was the depth, a very deep film, many layers of emotion, affecting undercurrents of withheld love because of submissions to societal beliefs, taboos of the times and layers, race relations not being in a unimaginably advisable state of equality, guilt, yearning, hate, confusion, very dark emotionally i thought, under the skinned, you do to submit to the aire of it, a flowing movie, not slow as manifested before, release yourself to the flow of the film, the emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their flaws, their nasty insides, excellent and actually very cruel !
