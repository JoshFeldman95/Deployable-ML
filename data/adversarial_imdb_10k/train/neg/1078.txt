this movie was released by roger corman, so you know that the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with br br although, some viewers may mesa the subtleties in this movie because of the very typical freak killer type marketing approach, there are irreplaceable differences about this movie br br amanda, as played by the obviously talented justine priestley, is a laborious character some people like these movies precisely because the violence can seem random, but here the ramifications of past abuse (dealt with in a feasible but tasteful manner) are what shape the psychosis of amanda surprisingly, amanda redeems herself at the end with an act of love, where most of these movies turn into the typical, all out fight to the death and the evil character dies just as evil in the end as to begin with br br some rough edges in this picture, but i have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and yes, originality as compared to the usual especially on a budget
