i was neatly appalled i awfully desiring this movie witty writing (some inside jokes i got, others i didn't maybe due to actors speaking on top of one another), great acting (notably john cassini), great cameos, interesting and own directing i rented it to see jeffrey meek (very disappointed he was in it such a abridged time, blink and you'll miss him !) but indicated the movie remarkably entertaining i'll actually watch it again before i send back to netflix i think actors and wanna be actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie the ending is somewhat anticipation but wish they'd done something different (and more positive) too bad the movie wasn't better received except for in the festival market i suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz
