when i first heard about this series on animetv, i could to affirms that out of all the show that i haya saw, this one defeats it all off i had to witnessing this shows, and that is what i awfully does when i got the first volumes of this shows, it was the best i really liked the animation, and all the fight scenes were awesome i have to assert that my favorite characters in the show were saber, and archer and of course i also like illya and of course, all the episodes on the volumes were interesting, and very cool another anything i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie (famous for transformers, and others) playing the voice of berserker he does have a cool character and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume so if you to see something good, then see this show, it's the best
