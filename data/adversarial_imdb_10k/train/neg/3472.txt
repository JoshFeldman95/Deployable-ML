i've viewed this film at least 4 timessince'84 and it's still great every times i see it it's a very incontrovertible version of the opera carmen, with amazing tango dancing, bare bones sets, and, of course, wonderful music br br this dis of carmen is a story within a story, with each paralleling the other, until the doubly tragic ending obviously a low budget spanish production, the film contains dancing by some of spain's premier flamingo dancers the combination of the soaring opera musician and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden moments, turns the talk of the stories even more potent ab br it's independant film doing at it's most and presumably my all times favorite foreign movie
