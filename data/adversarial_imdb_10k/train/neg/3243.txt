i may be biased, i am the author of the novel the hungry bachelors club, self published in 1994 the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, fred dresch, who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer, i hope to expect the filmmakers in its together and i will further comment but jorja fox, who plays delmar youngblood, my character, is stupendous she carries the bulk of the emotionally vehicles in fine form i couldn't have done better myself ! this looks like actual people, hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home, gracefully and heartfelt
