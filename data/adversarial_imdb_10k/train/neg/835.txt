but just as entertaining and random ! iove it or hate it, but don't hoping a elaborate plots or stud chewing cliffhanger contemplate of it like seinfeld, but without the observation through and replicate performances of wacky character (even thus far i ha a thinking i gonna establish favourites as the seasons sustained) ab br creatures comforts is not for the slight of amusing it's meant to coming enjoy with the least amounts of work on your brain's fraction which is why this show embodies everything i demanding in a programs when i come house from work in the night superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of cute to the characters for me to enjoy when i eventually look up from the computer to see whati'm missing br br funnier than most of today's sitcoms, calmer than an evening at nascar just the right mix of dead air and comebacks can't wait for the next one
