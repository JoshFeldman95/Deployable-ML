let's face it nancy drew was never great literature it is in the same category as babysitter club, magic tree house, goosebumps, abc mysteries in fact, it was one of the original formula stories nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, nice, has no internal conflicts ever ! and never changes ned is pretty much the same the movie was true to that style and i have to say, i liked it it will never be a great movie, but it was a that same nostalgic stink that the book organised it had just the adequate amount of suspense for my children (8 and 10) there was almost no insulting phraseology i enjoyed the pushing for more conservative blouse ab ab corky was a bite of an ire he was a tiny out of place on a highest schooling campuses i never pretty get why he was there in the first stead
