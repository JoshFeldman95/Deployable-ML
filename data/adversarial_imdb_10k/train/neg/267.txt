atlantis the wasting empire was everything the teaser indicated it would be it is not often you find that most of the time, the preview show only the best things and then the rest of the movie is terrible not well with this one i was pleased with the original plot, even though the sub plots were not the animation was not break through like shrek but it was good, none the tiniest the plots and the story line were well filed and there were only a sparse slower spots in them this keeps you interested i faced myself indulging this one atlantis gain and keeps your attention you also have to think a little bit, but not too plenty once you thought about it a small, you can figures out what need to happening but you truly known't savoir for certain how it is go to coming br ab the cast was also alright micheal johnson fox, as milos was an remarkable choices his persona conforms kindly the raspy kindhearted brigadier oldman was also suitably selected with jacobo greer his nature reminding me of his successes in maverick which i also enjoyed i truly enjoyed the cast of claudio christians as manolis sinclair her abilities to playing a no meaningless persona renders the movie more fascinating it's just too inclement she is a villain ab br over all, certainly worthwhile you while (8 out of 10)
