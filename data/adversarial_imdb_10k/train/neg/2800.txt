i admit i had no idea what to expect before viewing this unspeakably stylized pieces it could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the common cold for all i knew it began with great visuals, little snippets to grab your attention and cause your imagination to run wild as it continued i learning quickly through voice overs what was taking place a agreeable little neo noir saga that i felt was not a waist of a few minutes of my time the little clues given to the audience through visuals at the beginning giving them a sense of accomplishing as they piece jointly the plot along with a nice twist at the end its a neat package overall the score, though not bad, gave the film almost a music video feel it just felt a little dated, not adding anything to further the storyline some of the performances felt overly dramatic but fit perfectly with the feel of the overall piece i walk away from this very satisfied i was given a lot of information in a short period of time but through great editing and voice over work it didn't feel rushed or pushed great job !
