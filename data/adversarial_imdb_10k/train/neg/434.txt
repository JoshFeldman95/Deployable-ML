what a perfect example of less is more kurt russell (sgt todd) only has 72 lines, and something like 104 words what a challenge ! like a black and white photo, when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotive gesture, all grouped to make a harder impact this is one of those haut 5 movies i can't lived without, right up there with the classics like road warrior if you liked this, check out mad max 2, the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison ford
