i don't giving a films or a show ten unimaginably often but this show slugged a nerve in a course no other shows has i found the entire series on mysoju com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see i wasn't dissatisfied in what i saw i was relocated this story stays on the tender side as the main characters wiggle us through the visuals sumire iwaya, played thoughtfully by koyuki, exemplifies we human type as she intends to keep nuisance from being shown no one effectively will to throw their soul out in frontal of a perspective mate until again she displace a human, played by an adorable matsumoto jun, as a pet this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet the difference he can retaliate in the same way, after all momo is a man, not a dog as he is treated like a pet, he reacts to situations how a dog might react she spends time with the new boyfriend, momo gets jealous it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick momo is a dance prodigy her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning, to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer, to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man, not as a dog in my opinion, it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop plus matsumoto plays momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as momo (the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy) states we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last watch this show with a open mind, it's worth it
