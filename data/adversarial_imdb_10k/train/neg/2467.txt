when i saw the trailers i just had to see the film and when i had, i kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied it was a great movie, don't get me wrong, but i think the great parts where already in the trailers, if you catch my drift it went very fast and it rolled on, so i was never bored, and i benefitted view it the humor was unequivocally peachy my first contact with a sloth (or something like it)
