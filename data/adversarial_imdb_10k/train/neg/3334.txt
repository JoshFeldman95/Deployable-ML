im a huge m lillard fan that's why i ended up staring this movie honestly i doubt that if he wasn't in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty allright a horrid ends i must say but i did imagining it coming it's a low budgets movie and some of the actors weren't really good but all in all i categorize this movie 7 10 br br the hoping of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what awfully keeped me interested in this movies br ab its a suitable rental ! brit brit 7 10
