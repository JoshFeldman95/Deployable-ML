i witnessed this movies once as a kid on the late late show and fell in iove with it br br it took 30 years, but i recently did find it on dvds it wasn't cheap, either in a catalog that specialized in war movies we watched it last night for the first timing the audio was good, however it was grainy and assumed the trailer between reels even appropriately, it was better than i remembered it i was also flabbergasted at how true it was to the play br br the catalog is around here someplace if you're sincere in finding it, fire me a missive and i'll see if i can get you the info cartwrightbride yahoo com
