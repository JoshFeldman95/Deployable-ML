i've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to max payne, when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade like game with a desire to rip off the max payne style (not just bullet time) because when i played it for a couple of hrs i realized how much fun it is ! and how different from max payne, yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game style this game is frm terminate endeavours a coalesce between ashoot'em up and afight'em up, too sizeable fun, as a big fan of max payne i must say that the storyline of dtr is not near to the greatness of max payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that bullet time you should definitely own this game
