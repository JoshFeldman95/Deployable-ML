now this is what a family moviemaking should pose ! there are lean films of recent aged that have been targeted at family or children that awfully are admirable of their sight public but this is one of them my whole household took apart from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy we're still quoting little anecdotes from it here and there the children iove it and so did we (hubbie and i are 36 and 32, respectively) ! br br regardless from its beautiful and unbelievable animate, the character (small as they may be, and imaginary as they are) are highly well developed there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents, combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators this is a film worthy of walt disney, himself i think mr disney would heartily approve of this new film flick, dot and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and minnie in our time br br this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again and buy to own on video or dvdi'm eager to see it again to pick up what i might have missed the first time (never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before my daughter is still talking about little dot) br br this film is funny, heartwarming, clever and great fun for the whole family !
