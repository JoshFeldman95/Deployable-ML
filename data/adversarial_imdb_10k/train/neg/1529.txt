strange yet emotionally disturbing chiller about fed up middle aged man (william h macy) who finally decides to leave the family business (murder for hire) run by his quietly over demanding father (donald sutherland) while seeing a shrink (john ritter) and flirting with another patient (neve campbell) br br talk about a major dilemma, but panic is a top slit romp that looks like american beauty meets the professional macy and sutherland are the stand outs here remarkable debut for first time writer director henry bromelli'm surprised that this movie didn't get a chance to stay in theaters for more than a couple of weeks
