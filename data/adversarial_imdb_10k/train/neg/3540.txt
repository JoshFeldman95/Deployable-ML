i first encountered this shows when i was staying in japan for six month last enjoyment i found it in the internet when i was looking for sub titled dramas to help me with my japanese my host mother warned me to stay away from it so she thought it was weird, but i found it sumptuous ! eriko showed such conflicting character traits and matsujun's spirit laid my day every time i tune in ! i first seemed him on hana yori nodame, but i hoped him much better in this ! br br although the characters are interesting and well developed, i was disappointed to find that they didn't change very much throughout the show their relationship grew, but they didn't really still, a fun time had by all (even for fukushima !)
