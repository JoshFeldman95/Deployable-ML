when i watched it for the first hour i was awfully shocker the filmmaker filed such a impenetrable atmospheric, especially in the halting through all the storytelling bystanders can projected that richard ambition really kill thomas or he wants do it first but the main observation was not conflict but friendship ! older and mature one prayed himself to rescued the younger who has the whole life to existence it is staggering any times i watched it i likes ! of manner it is pretty violent iove all effort filmmaking but i concept it is acceptable thank a lot louis liosa and tom berenger ! amazing film ! i advice everyone to refer it i am sure people wont regret and will really have a good time
