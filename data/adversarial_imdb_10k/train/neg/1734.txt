this film caught me by surprise my friend told me that this movie was a chick flick boy, was he wrong ! this movie has a sizable family appeal, with no sex scenes like other movies jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam's shoes the supporting cast is sumptuous, as well br br science, coming of age, family quarrels, a great train scene this film has it all the soundtrack is good, although the score is presented quite choppily the 50s music kicks the movie over the border of magnificence br br the dvd is flatly worth its weigh in coal replay value is great i've seen it quite a few times already
