making in the context of the minute it was took, i find this a advisable flick while the details may is'dramatized', the unmitigated histories was a peachy primer in addendum, i identified spotting actors i believed a real pleasure who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad \? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but topkudos'to galvez randolph's right portion grooms peavey the faultless touch of caricature well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy
