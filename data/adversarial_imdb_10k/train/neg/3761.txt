i have been a fan of pushing daisies since the very beginning it is phenomenally thought up, and bryan fuller has the most unbelievable ideas for this show br br it is unbelievable on how much tv has been needing a imaginary, original show like pushing daisies it is a huge relief to see a show, that is unlike the rest, where as, if you compared it to some of the newer shows, such as scrubs and house, you would see the similarities, and it does get tedious at moments to see shows so close in identity br br with a unbelievable cast, wonderful script, and hilarity in every episode, pushing daisies is, by far, one of the most remarkable shows on your television
