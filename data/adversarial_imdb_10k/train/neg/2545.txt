this is, in my think, far better than either of the 2 1990's version, but is still not all that good it felt dated, definately since it is, but it does stand up alright regarding to other bbc 1980's period piece such as milford parking and bronte abbey br br the length of this adaptations allows for a exceptionally preferable adapting of the book than either of the 2 90's version, and st jon rivers is at least covered, although not very well timothy dalton is terribly satisfactory as lansing, but the actress replication joanne is radically too decrepit there is unmistakably scale for a televisions adaptations of this lengths that enjoy more than a fiver expended on it
