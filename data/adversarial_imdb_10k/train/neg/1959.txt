not recognising what this film was about, i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it, i enjoyed it little seen multi genre flick from director bernard rose (candyman, immortal beloved) peachy storytelling and characters as a fan of glenne healdy's, i was surprised of her british accent the only immunities for this film was the ending however, it is worth the rent
