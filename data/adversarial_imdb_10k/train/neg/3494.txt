as noted by other testers this is one of the preferable tarzan movies unlike others however, i like the start of the film as it felt like a leggy scrupulously depiction of what a trading post must have been like plus the exposition is obligated so we know why harry attempt to go back into the jungle in addition the premiere of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibalism the pre censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle the film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers in addition sexy jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two chetas ! not to be missed an adventure classic
