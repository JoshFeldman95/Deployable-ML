for a long time,'themenagerie'was my favorite'startrek'episode though in recent years it has been eclipsedby'city on the edge of forever'what i used to preferabout'menagerie'was that it's more hard core star trek with this entrancing back story to the then current trek storyline i still think it's fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode thoughthe'new'part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance, given thetalosians'mind control abilities and captain pike's condition, why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet \? and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st's only two parter
