i've only watched the first series on dvd, but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a coppola like script the instalment is as good as goodfellas and baccarat, and almost as adequate as the godfather (hence not a 10), and severely decent than any of guy ritchie's efforts although there's plenty of action, some of it pretty bloody, the storytelling is idiosyncratic driven even some of the minor characters contribute to sizeable storytelling lines e g the priest's relate (or inadequacy of) with carmilla and the restaurateur's wife, and christopher and his dimwit friend (who didn't last very long (a darwin award nominee \?)) br br apart from the plot, the script and the acting, the other reasons i liked it br br 1 it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce 2 the music 3 it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
