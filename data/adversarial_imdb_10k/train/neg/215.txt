buster absolutely glistens in this episode, which is the only vehicles i've seen towards the complete of the careers that permitted him to doing the physical (and silent !) comedy that tabled him illustrious it's also a flabbergasted to hear his gravelly noises in the talkie scripted his loud is about the only thingie i maken't care for, as far as buster is concerned but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two reelers with roscoe arbuckle br br my deepest gratitude to wand serling for presenting us with this episode, and for giving buster's genius full scope he didn't have much time (one episode) to do it in, but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius
