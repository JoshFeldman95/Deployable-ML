i saw the monumental inauspicious swam at the 2006 temecula film shindig, and was totally caught off guard by how many i was drawn into it br br the film centers around the lives of a pools of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons a humorous idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for greater changes in thestudents'lives br br what appalled me about the film was how real it felt intermittently in ensemble piece are characters treated so well i enjoyed the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was very poignant nothing emerged out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling, much like attending school or summer camp where you find fast friends, form strong bonds, and make discoveries about yourself, yet have to depart all too soon br br my only complaint was that the character of paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed i suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though br br aside from this, i found the film very well rounded and quite enjoyable see it if you get the opportunity
