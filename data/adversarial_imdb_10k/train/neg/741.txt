wasn't hopeful what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it hadn't disappoints br br for me one of the showcase was the final episode with the american tourist schmooze with a dreadful french accent (which made me feel better about mine) which was actually quite touching and a sizable way to wrap up the movie br br the tale of the paramedics and the stabbing victim was also very budge and for pure comedy the coen sorority and roberts buscemi take the prize the tom tykwer clip was also stupendous although rather adventurous in its scope br br however, the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible br br on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections they only last 5 minutes anyway br br ca vaut la peine ! ! !
