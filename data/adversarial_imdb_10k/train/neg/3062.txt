thieves and liars introduce us with a very philosophical depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many puerto ricans and force them to make difficult if not impossible choices about their and their lovedones'lives the cast is excellent, considering that some are non specialist actors an unbelievable selection that augments the level of reality in the film the photography propels the story without intervene, as it requisite be in this type of film the script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the boricuas in a very deep course sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary ! watching this film you feel as if you've secretly entered the real puerto rican society and stand invisibly watching it implode i loved it !
