this is a flick that can introduce you hoped to expect it again i essentially, preferred the manner it ended i did not see the end imminent, but when laws was not pouring away the first time, one suspects he will be back again br br the story is captivating and could have been more psychological, but i admit the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was adequate for that br br hard to contemplating michael jr could be so unequivocally indifferent as his younger brother and mother as blown remotely but, i can grateful the scene play couldn't really take our attention there because it had a higher stories to tell br br some have complained about hanks as a gangster i believe that isn't justified if his character had been any harder, he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not br br eight stars for this one although it was released in 2002, i just saw it for the first time yesterday on dvd
