i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night, not knowing what to expect i had heard of this movie, but never really any opinions on it br br i have to say, i was awed with what i saw i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times br br the blob was scary seeks now, i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it'll latch itself onto my hand br br steve mcqueen was awfully adequate as steve andrews, the actor of the film i also prefer the old man in the beginning br br for a 50's horror movie, this was very well done even by today's standards br br 8 10
