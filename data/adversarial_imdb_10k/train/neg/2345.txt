i've seen a great many films,but'in cold blood'stands alone in a class by itself it excels in every department the fact that it contained few big stars serves push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story, rather than the name on the marquee blake and wilson turn in stupendous performances of the killer duo the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crimes took place, even inside the very house, add additional chills the black white photography dulls the mood and the portraiture is unbelievable there are many admirable cinematic works out there, but if i could only votes for one to topped the lists, it would most presumably are in cold blood
