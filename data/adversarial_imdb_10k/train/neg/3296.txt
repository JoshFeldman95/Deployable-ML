come on people this movie is better than 4 i can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this and it was funny br br i watch a comedy to be entertained, escape from the pressures of the world for a short while, and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully skirts that purpose i judge a filmmaking on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing saddles i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring, agreeable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes, watch this one
