this movie unequivocally gets a thumbs up from me it's quips jokes and even it's piecemeal stereotypical and derogatory insight on southeast europeans people took me in stitches throughout most of the film it's plot is clever and 100 upfront and will have you guessing throughout the entire film the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside ofthe'chickflick'genre she's used to her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well executed it is the better performance i have ever seen from hilary, and i have seen most of her films her character, yonica babyyeah is describedas'the britney spears of easterneurope'and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song,'i want to blow you up' you also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, yonica is a very complex and confused character joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout i strongly recommend this film
