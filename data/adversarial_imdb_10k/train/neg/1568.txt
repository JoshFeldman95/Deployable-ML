only seen season 1 so far but this is just tremendous ! ! a wide variety of people stuck on a island nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets it sounds like melrose place meets the crusoe family and why is that so great \? it probably is not but then ad a spoon full of x files, a dose of what \? \? and a big hey and a island that is everything you ever dreamed of in your freakiest nightmares and you'll arrive lost to the story gotten so many revolves and turns it is unbelievable admirable set up, powerful acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody i think) with good and bad sides but weird oh so weird
