ettore scola is one of the most important italian directors my parents and i watched togetherc'eravamo tanto amati on a summer night we liked it, but we didn't love it as we loved a special day i believe ettore scola is pretty underrated we often forget to remember him, maybe so his latest films were disappointing and well, yesterday night, my mum and i sat on our sofa to appreciative this linchpin writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and appropriate, but the thing i liked the most was the chemistry between loren and mastroianni they're both excellent actors and play the main roles of antonietta and gabriele antonietta is an housewife married with a fanatic fascist, she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families gabriele is simply an anti fascist they spend together a special day, that special day of 1938 when hitler came to rome visiting mussolini i don't want to spoil anymore about the plot go looking for this film !
