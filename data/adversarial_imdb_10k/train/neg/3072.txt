i thought the flick was actually somewhat good i enjoyed the acting and it moved along well the director seemed to awfully fathom the storytelling he was trying to tells i have to see the big budget one coming out jour, evidently they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable when you see a movie like this for a small budget you have to take that in to account when you are viewing it there were some things that could of been better but most are budget related the acting was pretty good the f x and stunts were well done a couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst and the boy who played the child these kind of films have kept la working and this is one that turned out ok
