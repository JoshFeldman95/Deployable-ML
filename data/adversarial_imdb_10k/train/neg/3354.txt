the title of this film nearly put me off watching it not being a manchester united fan, the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting, however i put my prejudices behind me andi'm glad i did br br i wasn't expecting much of a film, but i was pleasantly surprised the film sped along with me never seeing at my watch and i enjoyed any second of the film if you liked east is east then you'll enjoyed this filmmakers ok so the storyline is nothing updated, and the classic storylines are contained within the filmmakers but it's all done awfully funnily, and with a breath of fresh air the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour, and best of all it's a good british comedy
