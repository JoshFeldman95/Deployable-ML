i rented the film (i don't think it got a theatrical release here) out awaiting the worse the previews incurred the film watch awful i was in fact very surprised, it was best worth watching it was loosely scripted, almost like an ensemble piece of film it had some very kidding moments in it and although inaccurate is an effective satirical on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing it is flawed, mainly by the awful soundtrack ofbludgeoning'comedy'effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way br br at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer, he is also an easy target springer could have made citizen kane and it would beproclaimed'the worst film ever made' i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film
