when i went to staring this movie my expectation were really low, but i was mercifully surprised br br i thought i was letting to watch a boring teen flick, but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and the fight scenes were for a low budget movie very bueno done br br i think this movie deserves a ample audience than it has received it is a movie, which can be seen by the whole family maybe not the smallest of kids, since it contains some rather rough scenes a movie about love, and the problems that can occur, when you go against your family traditions br br yes, the movie is very much like bend it like beckham, but i actually think this movie pulls it off better
