i first saw this film when i was about 13 it stumbled me away then and in many respects it still is now but i am less inclined to see it as an accurate historical piece now there is precious little effort made to examine and interact with the racism and thus fails to recognise that the most potent anti racism weapon is to understand it at its very core in those who commit it what we get instead is a dichotomy on the one side, beko and woods in 3d panoramic rainbow farsighted on the other, two dimensional characters are portrayed as unapologetic unthinking evil br br this all makes for a great film story, but it worries me that people see the portrayalas'accurate'
