every time this flick is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war planetary of ingestion and the welfare state i don't devine this is the point of the film at all the film parodies the spivs (small time criminals who ran the blackmarket) and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation br br yes of course the filmmakers sends up the political social situation but in the end the people recognize that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society, they want to be british and muddle through absolutely than foreign br br but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before
