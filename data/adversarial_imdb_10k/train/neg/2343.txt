vincent cassel plays the part of paul, an ex con assigned to an office job where he meets carla, a secretary who is quite deaf', when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not (played by emmanuelle devos) jointly they help each other to development as people br br what was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters not fitting into obvious stereotyped paul appears uneasy in the office environment, is it that he's just not cut out for work \? this belief is evaporated when he gets a job in a bar and star br br the film has a certain amorality which i find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally, even if we think it is harmless or justified br br finally, it is a film full of greatmoments'both touching and humorous one is when carla is babysitting and is trying to comfort a screaming baby she continues to cuddle it but takes her hearing aids out for her own comfort
