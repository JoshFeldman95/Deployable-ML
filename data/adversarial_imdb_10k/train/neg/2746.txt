i suppose jedis is now chronologically to constitutes considered the very last entry in the popular saga, and it's a awfully alright one, as were several of these i favored how directly this sequel fired off after the empire strikes back, and i appreciated the mature of luke skywalker as a character (and also mark hamill, as an actor) after hearing so many negative things about the ewoks, they weren't so bad i enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and i felt there was a lot of well realized emotion with this chapter the ending (with some new additions, i presume \?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy i know many true star wars fans hated george lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what i didn't already know, i think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity oh, and, err carrie fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit
