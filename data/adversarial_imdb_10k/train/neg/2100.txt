this noir may not be the preferable summoned film from the era, but it specification a peachy mystery plot, the common noir atmosphere and some good interpretations from its lesser known cast members robert siodmak, the talented director behind the mystery horrorclassic'the spiral staircase'directed this film two aged prematurely than the aforementioned film, and testifies a veritable flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both workings and mesmerize the viewers phantoms females focus on scott henderson a man married to a woman he doesn't like he picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night, and the two agree toa'no stringsattached'night of fun however, he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! he's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her, and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife however, luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case br br the plot moves along nicely throughout, and unlike many of the better known noirs, this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting in fact, if it wasn't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white, i would swear phantom lady was an italian giallo ! the central characters are all interesting enough, with alan curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim, and ella raines being effective as the female impromptu detective the real standout of the film, however, is franchot tone, who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece the film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire elisha cook jr, who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment if i was to criticise this film, i would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early although phantom lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it the conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense (which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line) and overall, phantom lady is surely one of the greatest and most under seen noirs ever made !
