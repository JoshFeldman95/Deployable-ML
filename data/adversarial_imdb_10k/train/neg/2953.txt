a unbelievable and gritty struggling cinematography that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid although it is tough and nasty it is in the end heroic schmid's triumph over impairment and depressed the fighting scene was superb but one bone to pick no matter how many 50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts ! it hurt the realism, but i can live with it fine performance by eleanor parker, again, as his girl friend
