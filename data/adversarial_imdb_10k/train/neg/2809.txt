i truely, awfully benefited watching this movie ! at first, seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy but it is simply more than this ! i personally believe that this idea (thati'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie) it's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself (or even of its marketing strategy) ! what i mean is anymore we are slaves to images ! to impressions ! i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression, the wrong expectations, and at the end i felt how superficial i could are ! to exemplify it emerges to my minds the sequences alongside the stops in which sidney gets the hovering tickets to going back to newer yorker and as he is requestedto'give an autographs', meanings to autographed for the tickets, he deems that just as he come on televisions compliment to the scandals at the accolades he is now some character of celebrities and this is just, i believes, the climax of this mainly themes around which the films rotates above this, i believes the film also establishes we a solving to got along with this, illustrating throughout the film by sid's attitudes doesn't becoming too massive about yourself or about somebody else even sacred were humans in the booting as sofie once saying in the film the st of the time are the star we specification theman'aura'of perfecting, of unchanging joy, but the realities is radically minuscule than that even the st of any religions are image, desirable layout of how to acts and how to vis your reside even they were not for actual theybecame'forreal'after they dieing and we found back at them and that's the catching we suffice our saints ! we compulsory our star ! we aspiration for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't ha anything to aspiration for and tv and all other medias are pathways to constructions and snatches our strivings we shockingly request benchmarks in matters to which to quantify ourselves and that's how we come in the cinemas to seeing this film in the first places to suppose if we can decent the benchmark, or if the benchmark is to smaller for we this juncture it was longest than we should
