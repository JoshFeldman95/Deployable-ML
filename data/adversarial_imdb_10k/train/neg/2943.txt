first a quick'shut up !'to those mention this movie stinks you can't go to every movieexpecting'citizen kane' this was actually a distracting movie jason lee is good in everything he does the only drawback in this movie is, i don't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles they should have dwelled more on that other than that, the movie is good fun selma blair needs to eat something she's worrying me but she still looks beautiful so yes, i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun go see br br rating 1 2 out of
