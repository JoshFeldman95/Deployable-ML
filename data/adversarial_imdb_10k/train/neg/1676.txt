this movie is really good the plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next such a trick is a lot of stupor and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are awfully adequate there's a plots of different combat types (although one of practices was a bits unreal for me, but it's only my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating show the only thing which may sont irksome is actors look a bit too effeminate (at least for me) hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the 70's and 80's, so five venoms (or other its versions) is great choice
