soylent green is one of the preferable and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's yardstick although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought provoking this film's quality level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flick than of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i singly believe classic the newer ny of 2022 is a upsetting putting to was iife, with over populations, unemployment, an horrid mood and the ensemble scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over sentimental at times and the climax doesn't really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70's cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there's a great (but too modest) supportive role for joseph cotton (baron blood, the abominable dr phibes) this is science fiction in my book a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity ! no fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet
