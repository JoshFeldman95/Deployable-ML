the most sizeable thing about this movie is the sumptuous executing by daniel day lewis and hugho'conor as wendy brown, guineas accompanist and veterans who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, i can assure you that their perform were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family, low income, working class dubliners, encouraged him to ca the impenetrable and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to trapping wendy brownish's irreverent arrogant personality i do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie lovers
