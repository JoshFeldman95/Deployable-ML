my first bresson was a wonderful experience film and alternative cinema (small hall, with uncomfortable seats public had to wait while filmrolls were changed) were perfect match br br there were sizeable cliche used in the film, but fassbinder presented them so reasonably that i found them really amusing sound was also sumptuous (sometimes back being louder than dialogue) br br everything seemed to be in right place and i liked the way how after hostilities time was presented veritable amusement ! br br
