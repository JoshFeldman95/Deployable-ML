the titles argues it all ab abi'm not a moviemaking critic nor determination i act like the rest of the snobbish inhabitants insinuating on this moviemaking ab br obviously this cinematographic wasn't have a multi million dollar budget, but the plot was awfully properly done, the behaving was peachy and the cinematography was great ! it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie ! i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both, but i imagine this conceivably have been an error in the recording of the dvd br br i'll definitely be inspecting out other movies produced by brain damage films ! br br dylano'leary, cast and crew, i thank you !
