i had no idea what this flick was about or even figured that it existed until about 1 weeks than when i jumped upon when i was crawling for other cine that stared dominic monaghan i thought this film was a strange brainchild into the mind of a none sleeper and what his her mind may be going through in the hours that they spend awake when the rest of the worlds around them is asleep, it was an interesting film and a good part was played by dom i believe that even though this film you cannot buy anywhere (well i've never seen it anywhere) you must see it if you ever get the chance because it will really make you think about those people around us that cannot sleep and have to suffer night after night of not been able to sleep or only get about 1 hour of sleep every night so overall it was an interesting film of good substance
