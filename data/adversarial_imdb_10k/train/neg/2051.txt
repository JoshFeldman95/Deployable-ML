the groove tube was beforehand reported on video, in the first video theaters here in boston in one room, there were tv monitors on high stands, with old movie theater seats, in small groups facing the monitors there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi, and baskets of york peppermint patties in a second, smaller room, there were no seats, just large pillows that was the'smoking'room, i e, people got high in there that act only added to the hilarity of the video br ab i wasa'frequentviewer' the scene i prefer most and rember to this day are koko the clown, the kramp family kitchen (kramp easy lube shortening), safety sam vd psa, the chevy chase hitchhiker w nude runs through the woods, the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman the last item was very reminiscent of the late, incredible ernie kovacs now, i've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 (who is ernie kovacs \? \?) but trust me, it's funny stuff br br one reason i wasa'frequentviewer'was that i, and my friends, would bring other groove tube virgins to see it we would sit and slyly watch the faces ofthe'virgins'as the safety sam psa would play as the camera slowly zooms in on sam, we would wait for that oh ! of recognition onthe'virgin's'face each time was more hilarious than the last and thenthat'virgin'would then bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we had done to get this joke, you must watch the video br br yes, some of it is dated, but most plays, film, television, and now videos are just look at any video made in the 1980's br br i did see the groove tube in a theater as a film, a grainy transfer from the original video it had been cut, and was missing some of the original high point scenes br br the first saturday night live show, featuring chevy chase, elicited instant remarks of, that's the guy from the groove tube, so it was a precursor for chevy br br i can't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice over, coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy lube shortening and thinking of the kramp holiday loaf recipe always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store br br the early 70's were parlous times the groove tube was fresh, new, andreally'got'the humor of the times it offereda'hip generation', humor that wasn't available in any other format medium mjh
