i have seen this movie a whole jot times and it's amazing but the only thing with it was that in the beginning, there was too much talk of who's going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site, they avowed that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what's even happened to patty dunning now \? she is a pretty presentable actress she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s, but we haven't heard from her since i know for certain about thom rachford, who plays jerry, works for accounting at rd films but overall, i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
