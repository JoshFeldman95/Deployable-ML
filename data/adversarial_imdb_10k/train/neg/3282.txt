i am a sizeable fans of the film, but not for the usual reasons i think travolta and winger performed at higher than average rates, i idea the sets were representative of the location and the era, i liked the sound track and the charlie daniels band however, i feel the photographer was breathtaking ! since the interior scenes were filmed in the actual club and gilley's had low ceilings perhaps 10 12 feet high and the smoke that was supposed to simulate a smoke filled bar hung 2 4 footer below the ceiling the camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focus on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dancing, the low level of light that actually was in the bar ! what a feat ! sure there was auxiliary lighting, but in order to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low light shots ray villalobos (the camera operator) was outstanding ! he got some shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film thanks, ray great work !
