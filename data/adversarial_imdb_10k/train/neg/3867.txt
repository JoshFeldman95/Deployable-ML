i notions this was an magnificent movie the theme song is sweet !) anyway, the only thing that somewhat irked me was in the starting, when everything should have been normal it was very weird and implausible the big cable company is mainly whati'm talking about apart from that, the movie was awfully innovations i think that all the acting was well done, the actors acted out theircharacters'personalities perfectly everything fit together well it really is a shame that their isn't a soundtrack that would have been great ! than this is a canadian film, and because it is one of my favorites, i give this movie a 10 out of 10 !
