kudos to cesar montano for reviving the cebuano movie ! panaghoy sg suba is very good it has the drama, the action, the romance, and scene that will make you laugh br br while the story is not that original (a love triangle or make a four cornered love, japanese occupation, rebellion, american as lord), its presentation is something cool, especially it consumes it original language bisaya for the filipino, nipongo for the japanese and english for the american br br this movie will go as one of this annum's preferable pinoy moviemaking br ab go watch this !
