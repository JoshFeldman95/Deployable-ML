i have to admit, i wasn't expecting much going into this film viewing in my japenese film class, but this film really sucked me away the director does a unbelievable work following through with the title of his film, truly portraying a picture of madness i think the fact that this film is silent adds to the resemblance of madness, helping the viewer experience the characters inner world rather than the world outside his mind this film just added to my feelings about overseas silent films vs american, in that the foreign films effort much more to practising your mind and produce you think rather than gonna for the fluffy film always with the happy ends, exercising the imagination very little
