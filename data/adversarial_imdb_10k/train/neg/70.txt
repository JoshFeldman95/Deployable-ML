we looked this at one of the local art footage theatrical in the montrose strip of chandler, tx it was a utter suprise likened to the write up in the theater's journal but we were both grilled externally by the artistry it was incredibly done and (apparently) photography in a schloss (german name for chateau) somewhere in the munich area it is a very outright exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day to date constraints it is marvellous on more levels than i can remember we came household after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning br br the version we saw was in english (mostly) so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in (probably its original) german version i searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything would absolutely love to have a vhs or dvd version of this it explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner if anyone knows the writer director, please convince him to release again, preferably on dvd these days i cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties please, please bring it back
