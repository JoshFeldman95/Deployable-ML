i have always been a huge fan of homicide life on the street upon when i heard there was a reunion movie coming up, i couldn't wait br br let me just say, i was not disappoint at all it was one of the most fierce 2 lengths of television i've ever seen it was great to see everyone back again, but the worst mirth of all was to have andre braugher back, since the relationship between pembleton and bayliss was always the strongest part of an all together admirable show
