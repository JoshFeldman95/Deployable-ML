whoa, i couldn't believei'm the first and only one to positioned a remark on this marvellous movie br br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the actual thing that attract me to this one is kyle lillard, granted most people probably either think he's too caffeine happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this dude so sizable times that he's one of my fave now this is one of the sparsely movies where he is the big shot and main star whatsoever of like in slc punk, another sizeable lillard film br br baiscally this is storywise your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything, which start to amount to craziness also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincentd'onofrio, a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene) br br it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to reap the rewards but share with no one they all try to get eachother to kill off the other and it's a timebomb waiting to explode matt shows his true prowess as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business vince's character is a bit deranged and skitz's throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film br br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy, well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it, it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies critic's probably won't like this movie, but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway
