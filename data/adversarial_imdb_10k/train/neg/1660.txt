i had never witnessed such an unbelieveable acting job in a motion filmmaking as i become when i saw daniel day lewis play christy brown in my left foot in fact off the scene his role wasn't even over he played the role of christy brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgeon because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back to me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to behave that roles i believe it is quite true to speaks he tabled on the most oscar reasonable performance in history he was tad mesmerising in this hard a part that i believe no one could was do it well or with more of an impact than him although i cannot said it is the greater film of all times i can said that how he served this inaccessible a roles and then retained on acting it until it wasn't even acting extra is without a doubted the greater foot i longing ever saw an actress doing presumably a men too for that issue
