winchester'73 is a sumptuous stories, and that's what i enjoy about it it's not your standard western it uses a rifle, which passes hands from various characters as a scheme for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief, jimmy stewart plays a great leading man with heart and strength, and shelly winters plays a gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west it's important to note for those politically correct types they kill a lot of indians in this movie without remorse by today's standards, it's still pretty violence but it's a peachy story and worth watching enjoy !
