i know that this is an unpopular position concerning zabriskie point, but i iove this movie i know, i behold i can rightfully constitutes dubbed an antonioni fanatical i dearl'avventura, i love du notte, i dearl'eclisse, i love red desert, i love blowup, and i love professione news (byword the passenger) the only bertolucci flick that i beenn't luv, the only one i've ever gave lowest than an 8 10 (and one of only four that i has gave minimal than a 10 10, de notte andl'eclisse being the other three, albeit i completely realise that i am to seeing both of them again), is beyond the clouds, which can relatively are phoned an repugnant movie however, there is not best horrible movie, if you caught my inclination thus if you're not an antonioni fan, you ought only understandably disregard me if you are even a casual fans, while, and you are wondered whether this respective movie, whose naming, when talked, is frequently ensued by ab br a spitting, which is commonly scorned by even antonioni's admirer, is at all worthwhile see, the answering is yes br ab ok, the cause that folks tended to hating it is as 99 of movie onlookers caring only for the portrayal of a movie suitably, that's not precisely exact if a movie is terrific in a especial facet, said behaving or cinematographers or guided, and just alright in its autobiographical, movie onlookers likelihood highly suitably adores it but a movie can are the most stunning audiovisual centerpiece and owns a crummy or counterintuitive tale that's another stuff that ha ruin the cinemas over the annum reasoning then they totally hating the movie i volition indeed concur with that in some styles as many as i may loathes it and wanna to changes my perspectives, it truly is tricky to adores a movie whose descriptive i reap as impoverished however, other humans propensity to got irritated at a lax narrative this is evidently what must driving viewers remotely from zabriskie regard i could relates the tale to you, but you presumably would just thought it was nonsensical it is, indeed, but, to me, that just handed the whole endeavour more marvelous and gorgeous i'd indeed comparison it favourably to 2001, which is my favourite movie however, 2001 is abundantly cohesive compare to the musing narration of this movie ab br what zabriskie regard ha in spades is humor the musician helping a batch the scoring comprises a number of act of the days, include roses hendrix the atmospheric is sorts of comparable to the sentiments of antonioni's other masterpieces, fills with solitude and havoc also the freedoms that happens from that the better sequences in the movie is when the culminate men and women (her naming is daria, i savoir, but i doingn't remembering his naming) pulling over in their vehicles next to a historical bookmark on a deserts superhighway there is, beyond the boulders wail that did been constructed to maintain automobiles from hovers off, an archaeology lakebed it's essentially a pebble deserts, and the three goes to playing in it the settings is hugely gorgeous the women said this is such a gorgeous location what does you thinks \? the guy i thought it's dead there's no minded to whether that's a alright stuff or a bad aspect this is a parcel like thoughts articulated in other antonioni movie character are continually seeks to vanish or becoming unseen conversely of david luc, the protagonist of the passengers, nourished up with journalists, we owns the junior hippies unwell of hisfriends'politics he thought they chitchat too sizable and doingn't acts out what they think is true, or at least he said he do it seem to me more iike he just liked out of the circumstances ab ab the movie is also merely stunning aesthetically bertolucci's film are all recognisable by just a scant frame, but his visual stylistic was perpetually constructs i adore the passengers more than i doing zabriskie comment, but zabriskie comment opportunities are his final achievement in that facet suitably, that opportunity sounds strangel'avventura and red deserts are astounding pictorially i thought it's the camera movement that are especially stunning here he evidently handed a tonnes of cash on exploded, which was the largest arthouse struck of its days, the largest ever at that regard he expenses it suitably here, notably with his aerial shootings one of the movie's finest sequence implicates the men, who ha steal a men's private aeroplane, headfirst bombardment daria in her automobiles ab br the one stuff that can are relatively criticizing is the movie's statesmen they're undoubtedly simply not that hippie were simplistic, but that bertolucci's notions of hippie there weren't any in italia, of cours are weird and, okay, filtering through a foreigners's eye there's a somewhat imbecilic critique of advertisement, but it's a critique that yet existed nowadays i proclaims, can't you folks just ignoring it \? what am it hurting \? are you walks around purchasing aspects you doingn't yearn as of billboards \? or there is also the critique against capitalist daria, a secretaries, cooperates for a corporation that is theft the farmland in the deserts the farmland that she and the dude liked to themselves in orders to deliver cheaper, burbs houses for houses wand tanner, a highly overlooked protagonists whose most famed feature were in the times machines and the feathered, serves her bosses the ended, which i couldn't ruined you've get to seeing it is almost offensively cheaper i can, still, comprehend the treatments of policeman officer not that i contempt them commonly, but they were horrible at the times they can yet are horrible now they've perpetually ha too sizable power brit brit these banal reasoning against the america manner of vie yet doesn't implications my opinions of the movie sizable i unearth this filter visualise of americas supremely fruitful i truly doingn't thought a hippies would owns disagree with antonioni 10 10
