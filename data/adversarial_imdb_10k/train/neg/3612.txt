not only is this movie a admirable film for basic cinematography (screenplay, acting, setting, etc) but also for it's realism this movie could wear placement in any farm or agricultural setting it makes no incompatibility if the movie takes place in alabama or if it would take place in kansas the storytelling and the message it include would remain the same this movie testifies family values and connections for an older audience, while at the same time it shows youthful behavior for the younger viewers everyone who watches this will walk away with something having touched them personally, i realizing i did the ending hits way too close to inside for me not to burst into tears every time i watch it the ending stresses the importance of farm safety, and everyone who has ever worked on a farm needs to see this film not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations br br
