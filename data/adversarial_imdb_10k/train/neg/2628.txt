the sentinel idiosyncrasies a sort of run of the mill and cliched suspense mystery but is lifted with some adequate acting and taut pacing these stories have already for the most part gone through as sizeable permutations as we can bear, after what we're left with is how good is the acting, how smart are the setups and bad guys, how okay crafted is the main plot etc etc unless the sentinel does a dependable job given it's content michael douglass and kiefer sutherland both maintain some good screen bravado and attitudes eva longoria (first time i've seen her on screen) brings some satisfactory support the whole affair side of the story is utterly implausible knocking it down a bit, but it deserves slack worth a viewing if you like the genre
