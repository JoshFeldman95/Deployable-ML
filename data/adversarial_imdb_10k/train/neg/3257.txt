for fans of 1970s hammer type horror films, this movie should be a treat the only thing i didn't like about the film was the fact that peter cushing was wasted on the worst episode in general, however, this is a emphatic, spooky little movie if this is notamicus'best film, it's certainly one of them the nicest episode, rightfully saved for last, is the one featuring jon pertwee as a horror film actor it is really excellent as good as pertwee was in this rol, it's hard to think he didn't make more of these types of movies all in all, this is an entertaining movie, which scared the heck out of me as a child, and which still gives me the creeps to this day
