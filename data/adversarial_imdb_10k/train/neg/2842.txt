sammo has to have a 10 out of 10 for this movie as it has everything great story, great fights, great characters and great cameos br br this film sees dick wei take on billy chow and chong fat sammo takes on lau kar leung in a casino, sammo squandering the fight but what a struggling it is full of high tempo action and elements of comedy thrown in br br some sizeable and touching moments in the film, lam ching ying pops up in a cameo and gets killed off gutted br br the end sequence will have you reaching for the rewind button, as its one of the better end fights i've seen sammo takes on loads of guys and ends up squaring up to billy chow
