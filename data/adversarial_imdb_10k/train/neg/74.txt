tcm is keeping me awake all the time they keeping coming up with films ive never heard of senso now ossessione a awfully early film by visconti ! ! wow the italian version of the postman always rings twice sumptuous ! ! freakishly acted and directed never know of either leads who were noteworthy, clara calamai, as giovanna, and especially, massimo girotti as gino what a sensual man ! ! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 ! ! ! his look was ahead of its time many male stars from the 1950s were probably based by him he should have been a major world wide star ! ! the film is much better than the jack nicholson jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version (which i really like) with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit \? who can forget this italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it im going to buy it ! !
