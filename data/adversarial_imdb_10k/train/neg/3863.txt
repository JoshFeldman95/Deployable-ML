i pleasures movie adore this for their spirit, no pun intended its a adequate, sanitary filmmaking about a baseballs tooling that's dwindling behind, and a young fan wishes for them to win, unless his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he'd come back for him br br the spirit glistens through in two ways a funny cast with danny glover and a young joseph gordon levitt, and the heavenly heralds al, opting the assertive form of christopher lloyd its an loud movie it is you smiling, and admittedly involves you in the sports br br therein lies my gripe the one somethings that kinda buggers me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team there's absolutely nothing wrong with that i just find it odd that i should come away from the movie thinking the angels are a strong, cool team, when really my base loyalty, such as it is, lies with the toronto blue jays it's interesting, really if it's just a movie about an underdog kids team, then its okay
