imdb lists this as 1972 for some reason, but the other sources i've seen incorporated the noteworthy program note mark itas'68 doesn't plainly matter, except that it's awfully interesting to watching this synthesize collage of film and video (one of the first art works to merge the two apparently) in the context of the star gate sequence in 2001, released the same year pure abstraction isn't completely my thing, but i can bring it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this series of flowers, rohrschach blots, birds, etc is pretty compelling and quite beautiful certainly helped paved the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70s, and deserves to be better known
