i could looked the film at the viennale a few years ago, where the audience liked it i hoped it as satisfactorily, summer phoenix performance still haunts me, that s why i determined to write a comment br br the storytelling unfolds in hackney around 1900, where a jewish chicks determining to constitute an actress she tries desperately to become one, but it isn t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage, that she has talent and that she linking with the audience and appearing as a strongest human being ab ab there were certain review, were her performance was smashed, they accuser her of being dull, not able to bring life to her character i think that s her strong point, that s exactly what esther kahn should be and phoenix makes a brave decision to make her esther a rather boring girl so her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise br br the cinematography is great, the images of london around the turn of the century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was back then br br the only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie, you loose touch with the characters, after all it s only about finding the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film it s phoenix credit that we don t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour
