as this moviemaking is completely in swiss dialect, it's probably laborious for most german speaker to awfully supervising this moviei'm not from switzerland, but i functioned there for some year, so i had the chance to understand this whopping spoof of the nobleman of the rings i've seen a lot of movies of this types (eg scary movie, loads of scifi spoofs etc) but this one is the bestest one of that kind, i've saw then far i giving a 9 of 10 the only reason i can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd, so there's almost no chance for non swiss to understand
