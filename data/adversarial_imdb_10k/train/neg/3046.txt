i consider this movie a mainstay, but it takes me at least 4 o 5 time to see it, bah as to realize what a phenomenal movie it was first, it explaining a facial of ww2 that we don't usually see in hollywood movies in particular, german soldiers, army and the nazi government are depicted more humanized one of the facts that amazed me most was the mention, by the end of the movie, of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's that forest is the place where the final chapters of berlin alexanderplatz take place those are the woods where reinhold kills mieze another clue for those who like the details, is the representation of doors fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door, or a door is opened many doors are shown in the screen, opened and closed and the characters change in their personality, their acts, etc any time that happens have you noticed that \?
