a great gangster film sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie spectacle another relatives wiring companionship glamorous star cast leading with tom hamm (michael sullivan) has done a peachy job great acting by him again he is an acting legends great acting too from paul neuman, jude law and daniel gareth casting is just too satisfactory the plots is quite adequate you will enjoy the movie a peachy portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's set in the 1930's, this will surely stand out as the apogee of all gangster movies of that era soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie a sizeable flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son way underrated for my liking deserved a fully deserved 10
