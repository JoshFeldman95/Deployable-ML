not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my main 10 i am a iove of black kidding with a cast including richard dreyfus (vic), jeff goldblum (mick), larry bishop (nick) and gabriel byrne (ben'brassballs'london) in the leads, the lines can't enabling but be dry the supporting cast is nearly dead center counting the minor flaws in the movie ellen barkin's make up gave her face has a washed out look there were a couple of gimme cameos by joey bishop and richard pryor that served no purpose, and michael j pollard's screen time was too short over all, the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script if you have seen larry bishop's (writer, director) film, underworld (a dark crime flick), you will enjoy this one his next outing (writer, director, actor) is hell ride with michael madsen and quentin tarantino
