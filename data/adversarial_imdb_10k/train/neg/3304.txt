for those of you bizarre with jimmy stewart, this is one of his lesser films from later in his careers and, while it isn't a sumptuous filmmakers likened to many of his other pictures, it isn't shitty and is a decent time passers but not much more br br kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some unbelievable rationale, she decides to cast a curses on poor jimmy to introducing him decline in lover with her over hour, the cold and detached ms novak also launching to demise in lover with stewart and definitely in the witch's rule book, this is a unequivocal no, no ! ! br br the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the baby sacrificing nor the all powerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps) and, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world ! br br anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact, i almost scored the film a 6 it was really close
