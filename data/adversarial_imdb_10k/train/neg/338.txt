seasons after seasons, the players or characters in this shows appear to be people who you'd absolutely adore to hate is this show rigged to be that or were they chosen for the same \? each episode vilifies one single person specifically and he ends up getting killed off you enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick you enjoy seeing them screwing others, getting screwed themselves, playing dirty, getting it back, escaping and finally getting kicked out by trump the amount of tears also seems to be hiked by the season br br the rewards which attempt to compensate for past humiliation and privation are also heavily reduced in the newer season, its like you get to meet xyx who'll lecture you about uvw like who freaking cares \? the characters are so hateable, collectively and individually, that you wonder if they're paid actors \? the only sane one gets to win br br watch with caution and maintain a conscience those are your fellow human beings in the firing line
