despite the occasionally stilted acting and seen it all before story, this is a fairly compelling movie br br it has suspense, the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy, some of the visual effects are admirable and best of all, no ridiculously ill placed humour to entertain from the film, as too many (wannabe) horror films have in them now br br honestly, this isn't the purest film ever made, but it actually relies you in and at least makes an attempt at character development br br i was happier i watched it
