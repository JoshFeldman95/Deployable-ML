i actually found thismovie'interesting' then one deserving my lengths to watch and rent it is right some scenes were over the top on emotionalism, shouting, etc, but what movie doesn't stress its agenda, genreor'ax to grind' \? almost none ! what surprised me is that i reading a assessments elsewhere done by a s fran reviewer on another review site, but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his own review of the flick not of the movie at all anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends no car chases, yea ! ! being in an italian family myself, i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen the movie has its tear jerking parts as well it is what real life can be in such an environment nice movie
