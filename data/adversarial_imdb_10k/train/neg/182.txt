i emphatically iove this films ! i don't at all relate to all the other comments i have read about it i was completely enraptured through any second ! br br i found the story gripping, the acting intense, and the direction spot on i would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie even unless there was nothing scary about the story itself, i was soundly on edge through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening br ab i found that there were so many perfect choices made the casting, the script, the little bits of humor sprinkled in it there were so many points where the film could've gone for the cheap thrill, but it never did, and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately and for the last number of years
