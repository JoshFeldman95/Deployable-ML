the moviemaking had divergent fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an incite storytelling the script was clear (it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children) and was enjoyable and humorous at times there were a few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today (which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out) it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better i thought it was a alright movie for a family to has and the organization of information was just hurled at you which was something i doesn't like either but in all it was a alright film
