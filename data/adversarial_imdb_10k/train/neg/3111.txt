many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was adequately typical of clara's later silents, i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays a happy go cheerful hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this dude is spousal ! clara's lacking of modesty was shocking in the time, but i believe it lends to the sweetness and broad goofy of the filmmaking although unequivocally not a brilliant storytelling lines (sufficiently routine, actually), this flick is a alright showcase of clara's ability to make the audience laugh
