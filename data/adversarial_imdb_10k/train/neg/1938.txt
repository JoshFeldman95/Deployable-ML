the acting is pretty cheesy, but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area automotive engineers, this is a peachy film i even work with a nagoya supplier so that lend this movie even more funny br br jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show ! he looks pretty young here 17 years ago the opening scene, with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great br br leno also owns some bad a cars now, it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collectioni'm sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car br br typical 80s movie watch it and enjoy no computer generated crap !
