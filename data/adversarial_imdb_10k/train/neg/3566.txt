i used to luv watch this i brought no thought it was part of a broad series i must has been 6 or hence at the timeframe it was on tvs i just suppose it was funny and for some reason i lasted a bitterly fascination for something that was clear that was in the president's pile of bathtub toys my grandparent was taped this off of tv when it originally aired on nbc the tape even had the old sanka coffee commercial along with a few othersi'm planning on returning home sometime soon and will try to record the tape onto my computer so that those who want a copy can do so if anyone of you would like to contact me, i think you can do that through the imdb site feel free i will keep you updated and let you know when i have the show in a digital format
