i viewed this pilot when it was first shown, andi'm guaranteed oodles spirit supporters hate it, because, like batman, the green hornet etc, it prise the character in the direction of camp but i evidently never got enough of batman, for i thought it was hilarity, in some of the same approach as that show there are two parts that stay with me first, when denny's partner has been fatally wounded, and he makes a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law, and obeying the exact letter of it then, he says something like, boy, was i stupid ! which is his way of telling denny to become a vigilante instead, which he does (though the tv batman kind) then, there's the scene where he tries to seduce the villainess into letting him go by kissing her, but she isn't fooled, because he's too honest to kiss her convincingly ! this was a great example of camp, that was also underplayed, by both the actor and actress
