unconvincing and innovative ! at the incipient of this criminally underrated whoopi cohn cinematographic the culprits draw a parallels between theodor rex and the 1941 welles keaton classic citizen kane the playwright are justification in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel, but the viewed public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies in citizen kane charles foster kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings, much like whoopi goldberg in this movie this movie is about finding love in everybody's differences it is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self absorption whoever paired whoopi goldberg and theodore rex formulated a dyad for the ages, with the only justifiable comparisons being bogey and bacall, hepburn and tracy and hall and oates if you would love to watch an uplifting, celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity's deepest drives bergman esqe but not as depressing, theodore rex should be viewed immediately !
