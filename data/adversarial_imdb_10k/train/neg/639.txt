i luv this show period i haven't been watching very long, probably only about six months or so, actually, but it is now my preferred show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters, except i don't really care for donnai'm not profoundly undoubtedly why i just makesn't find her funny, and i don't think laura prepon is a very good actress other than her, i find the sojourn of the cast pretty adequate kurtwood smith and debra joe rupp, who played erics predecessors, were extremely funny topher grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans, i did not completely hate the 8th season i still watch it, and it does make me laugh but, if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons, its not good randy is horrible the finale was decent, nothing amazing, but good i do think it would have been better to cancel the show after ashton and topher decided to leave, but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd, and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes, in my opinion, were'dine dash','grandmas dead','red stacey', and'streaking', but i love every episode i've seen so far, which is most of them, i think 9 10 stars, i would definitely recommend it
