i wait for each updated episodes, each re run with await ! the new look of sci fi created by stargate grams 1 is a wonder that i hope eagerness never expiration to combine the past with the future is a recent twist that is tantalizing to me season 9 should be a gusto in itself i wish that richard dean anderson would show up more often in the new season, as i iove his dry wit as much as his temper tantrums in his character as jacko'neill the other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season you cancel this program in the next three years, and you make a serious mistake also, you need a bigger role for the asgard they are just too cool
