this is a thinking man's silly movie if you don't expect star wars and enjoy british humor this might just turn into a cult classic for you as it hectares for my wife and i from casting the voice of cary grant and sockets nicholson as martians to the disproportionately simplistic populace of big bean this is a flick that you can either sleep through or watch thoroughly and iike either way br br it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy relaxing easy humor that takes a quick mind to see the joke as it slips by you will enjoy this movie
