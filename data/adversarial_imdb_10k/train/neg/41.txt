afterseeing'break aleg'in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a awfully droll filmmaking br br i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos (eric roberts in particular) were a scream i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close br br the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations the script is effortless and seamless, the plot develops conveniently and the acting is cushy yet soft this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in, which is around 10 15 or so br br i highlyrecommend'break a leg'
