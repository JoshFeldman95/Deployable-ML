just followed this movies step of frank loesser's males and doll for the iii days with my mother who had never seen this before she was pleasantly stunned by the singing voices of jean simmons and marlon brando and she thought the havana scripted where simmons and brando dance up a storm were excellent those were pretty unbelievable to me too and were usually the highlights of the film instructed by joseph l mankiewicz, this movie which originated as a story by damon runyon wraps a while with the sluggish paces of the nah musical scenes at first but pulling you in after a while the other story with franco sinatra and vivian blane wasn't as compelling to me but yet got their charm notably during the sues me quantities also adored bulbous kaye's sitting down, you're turning the boats quantities and the spectacles of schwartz leonardo and ii s pully with a dramatic gaze throughout, blokes and doll isn't a grand movie musical but undoubtedly a highly alright one
