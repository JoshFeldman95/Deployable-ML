even albeit there are no new episode, and it is hardly showed i used to cared the pixie of sabrina and the juveniles witch i never got to embrace the last episodes, but i do want to fathom what happened to miles, or josh \? and why did the relatives have to disappear out of the show for good \?i'm guaranteed the ending went to be perfect but there are a lot of questions unanswered and i want to see the last episode of s t t w ! because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day ! i really hope that she picks harvey ! and may i say nate richart is hott ! ! too bad hes too old for me though melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show, but there are many little stupid things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening, its kind of stupid plus the cat starts to really get lame, as the show continued, the jokes began just to get stupid, and the things that the audio controlled audience would laugh at, i would think it was so lame don't get me wrong, at some parts it was funny, but i think the show just kind of lost its magic so to speak as the show went on i give kudos to all the cast though for trying, although that soleil moon frye girl had no taste, and she was a horrid actress i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter, now that the show has ended
