i thinking the film i get they makesn't was great in the old i've ticked snatching estes on suddenly debbie brookside locations and also liza bissett on belmont place and wished considering them along again in i fact they don't they have terrific chemistry together (i guess being married in real lived help that !) in the flick they are both widowed with children and careers and they fall in luv and try blend their already busy chaotic families together without dipping the ball of course they stumble, but they remain it together which is what working and raising a family is all about so many people have been talking about this movie all good ! and the movie left us wanting more this would make a great series appealing to many ages ! it would be so nice to see a real life, down to earth, family show like this that portrays the reality of so many of our lives today instead of the so called reality tv that all the stations are overwhelming us with these days someone tell the people at abc family they have the start of a new series here !
