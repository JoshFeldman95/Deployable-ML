this is a peachy movie for any fan of hong kong operate movies asides from it's little plot, the lifeless melodrama and bits of comedy antics, the movie is action packed with gun fighting and martial arts action kept me entertained from beginning until the end i thought shannon lee was awesome in the movie br br having an action director like corey yuen is what conserve hong kong action going strong this modern action film is highly recommended ! !
