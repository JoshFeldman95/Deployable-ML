i saw this movies tonight in nyc at the landmark sunshine i didn't know what to hoped, i'd not read much about it as i knew i would see it no matter what all in all, it is awfully perfectly done it doesn't purpose on the generalization of anti war statements, which to me, left the politics out of it the solider inherently said of their awareness of toxicity in their trained in booting encampment, and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life it was really adequate to see paul rieckhoff and camilo mejia tell about the tricky in surviving not only the war, but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals make no mistake this is not an anti war film anyone who says it is hasn't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls
