if you find yourself in need of an escape, something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world, domino will satisfy that need this is entertainment, after all ! the plot remain your brain in motion one of those movies (like usual suspects) where you want to watching it a second times to figure it all out i wondered about domino harvey herself, how her life became of interest to hollywood as for the acting, lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers and any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well not once did i think of kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume and granted, mickey rourke plays mickey rourke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people
