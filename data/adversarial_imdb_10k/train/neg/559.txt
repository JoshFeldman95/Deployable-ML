very generously done movie it does stay in your memory better billed as a romance than flying or war, altho the flying parts are real and almost error free flying buffs like myself will iike this movie even if attracted by the airplanes, unless they possesses no sensitivity or have never been in love br br fun watching early crowe he is good and exudes tempt his reading of high flight is unbelievable br br hurrah, boom
