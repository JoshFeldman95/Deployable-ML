the undoubted highlight of this movie is petero'toole's performance in turn wildly comical and terribly horribly sad does anybody do it better thano'toole \? i don't think so what a great face that man has ! br br the stories is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially toward the end) but it is also oddly touching and does managed on incalculable levels however, i felt the film basically rotates around petero'toole's iridescent performance andi'm guarantee i wouldn't do enjoyed it even midst as much if he hadn't been in it
