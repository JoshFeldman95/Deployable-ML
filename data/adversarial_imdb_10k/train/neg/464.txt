i be to starts saying it has been a long time since i have seen it, but have viewed it 5 or more times a peachy little romp that was clearly predicated by the musical hilarity pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example br br having spike jones freed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action, doing a fine job of support hugho'brien plays the face, buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus, abbott and costello replacing the leads don't know if that was true br br all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released, as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
