this film is not great, but it is a decent and gentil one it feels like an indie filmmakers fulfilled out of a play script morgan freeman basically plays himself, although the director swears the script was not written for him and there is the small irony of the actor that goes in a supermarket to do research for a film that he hasn't committed to yet i mean, he actually made the film in the end and we are watching it) br br i found the dialogue a piqued too positive for my taste, but refreshes even this is a film that incite the viewers to take a seem at their own lives and choose the direction in which to go a bit too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me br br bottom line a nice little film, made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes morgan freeman look good)
