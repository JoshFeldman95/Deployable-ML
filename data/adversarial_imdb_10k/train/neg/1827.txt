i think this filmmaking has far to recommend it, particularly an especially sinister perform by david morse and a more than passable performance by the always worth watching mr foxx although there are a lot of holes in the plot and the motivation is very, very troublesome to follow in some cases, all in all, it makes for a peachy time in front of the tube
