i was an usherette in an old theater in northern california when this filmmaking came out as optimum as it is on dvds, it's even more eerie and creepy on the big screen although it has been about 9 years than i have seen it, it is still one of my all minute chose at the dicey of inquires trite, they just don'tmake'em like this anymore ! if sixth sense freaked you out at all, this movie is definitely for you ! great storyline, incredible cast of characters, ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it i overly recommend you not watch it alone what a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone, will have you gasping (it would be at least 10 times that price today)
