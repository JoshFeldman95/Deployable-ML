allright, but just mere dumb not nasty for a horror comedy film i was reading how people switched it with the michael version and that is a good trick in my advice because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will receive them interested in horror films like this one or maybe (never seen it) the horror (possibly funny) uncle sam, i'll have to see about renting or buying that flick but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on vhs of amazon and got it november 21, the day before thanksgiving worth the four bucks, l o l at this film br br 9 10
