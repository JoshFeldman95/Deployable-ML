the first hour i saw this flick i luv it when i was 11, i was more interested in the music and dancing as i've grown older, i've become more interested in the acting as well while the first half is just a retrospective of mike's vocation (from the jackson 5 up to bad), it was still entertaining to watch the crueler sequences could've been left out, unless the kids were pretty good accelerate demon and leave me alone were funny, specially when the police officer tells michael, i need your autographs right here, after stopping him for danced in a no dancing zone but it's smooth criminal that's the icing on the cake joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild) the dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects the only thing i could have done without was the spiders any fan of michael's should see this, if you haven't already i give it a 10 !
