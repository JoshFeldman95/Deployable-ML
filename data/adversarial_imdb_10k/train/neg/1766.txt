i saw this film a few years ago and i got to say that i really iove it jason patric was perfect for this weird rol that he played the director \? i don't too many things about him and i don't attention the screenplay is good, that's for sure in just a few words i have to say about this movie that is wierd, strange, even dark, but it's a adequate one i saw it a few years ago and never saw it unless then i want to see it again and again i know thati'm not wanna achieve sick of watching it the scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story everything is good the movie should have lasted longer i think 120 minutes should have been perfect i was hoping for a part 2 for this movie too bad it din't happened jason patric you're the man ! very good movie the end)
