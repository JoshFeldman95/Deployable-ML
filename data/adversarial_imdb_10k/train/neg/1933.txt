if you have a chance of watching this films do consider it it's quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it's not didactic in my opinion it's a fragment of art unimaginably filmed, fine music of miscellaneous styles, the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to forecast from bbc drama nathalie press (billedas'natalie'press) is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate celia imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there isactually'normal', but the real star as always is timothy spall surely one of the greatest actors of our time !
