i'm disappointed at the impossibility of posts on this admirable and usefulness little filmmaking jordi molla, probably best known for his role as diego in ted demme's blow writes, directs, and stars br br i won't give away any plot points, as the movie (at least for me) was very exciting having not known anything about it if you have a netflix account, or have access to a video store that would carry it i overly advising it it's a crazy, fun, and sometimes very thought provoking creation br br molla's direction is quite impressive and shows a lot of promise br br unpredictable, with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful spanish no somos nadie (god is on air) is an amazing film you can show off to your friends br br see it
