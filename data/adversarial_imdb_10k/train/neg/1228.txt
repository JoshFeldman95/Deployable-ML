in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a admirable job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotyped put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap definitely not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but preferable than an average college movie
