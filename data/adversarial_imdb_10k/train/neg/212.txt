i contemplation this show is screamingly laugh ! it's not for any taste, andi'm not going to elevate or denigrate the people that maken't getting iti'm sure they're peachy bright people that operate at a different wavelength but if you iove it, you awfully like it sarah plays a self infatuated loser named sarah silverman who often finds her self in homerian predicaments (that's homerian as in homerian simpsonian) br br i remember sarah silverman from her brief gig on saturday night live in the early 90's i liked her immediately then and i go out of my way to check out anything she's done br br this show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny therefore i always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers check it out !
