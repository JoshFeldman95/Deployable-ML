equally not actually this movie is very entertaining though went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the i think there might be something in my eye routine the movie is a gargantuan combination of comedy and typical romance jim carey is extraordinaire as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides in fact all the personages are great the movie is not extraordinarily funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife br br all in all 8 10 note i am not an easy grader thats all from bigv over and out !
