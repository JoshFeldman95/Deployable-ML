an imaginary, unnerving calisthenics in claustrophobia a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely setting in two rooms not completely successful, but taut, surprising and well acted one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw two men trapped in room and pitting against each other but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film it's like watching a lab experiment some might researching the contained suspense tedious, but this reviewer indicated it enthralling the beeping and imagery of the filmmakers are freakishly well realized this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system just right for a late night movie fest, when one is in the paranoid mood it certainly kept me awake that night
