i newly watchedthe'54 version of this film with judy, and while i appreciated the story and composers, i found that the film failed to hold my attention i contemplatedthe'76 remake to be the same story, except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, dear and the price of it all this version is so much more actual thanthe'54 one, with arguably better music, better acting, a more unfolds plot line, and, of course, a harder love i don't understand why the previous film is on the american film institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic's list
