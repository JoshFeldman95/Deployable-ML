i read some previous comments stating that this movie loses steam towards the end of the movie and also that it has a similar ending to cape fear i completely disagreei'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there i thought the casting was perfect i cru this was one of ed harris's preferable performances what an mischievous psycho ! ! ! i could a lot of respect for his acting after viewing his performance in this movie i was riveted throughout this movie if you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you hoped to see i also noticed a young scarlet johansson in this movie this filmmakers is fills with topped star and i eminently recommending it !
