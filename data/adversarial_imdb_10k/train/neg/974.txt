i went to see this movie twice within a week and can only sums it up in one word (which i generally maken't utilize nicely) wonderful ! in my conceptions, the best movies ever made who deserve oscar and other accolades if not this scandinavia sailors who have created filming perfection in the last scenes of the film, when everything that is outlined (and abandoning unasked) throughout the storytelling is drawn together \? just as the character of daniel dareus reinforces so many sentiments and long punishable feelings within the mankind around him, the movie doing the same to its audience you walking out with your head abuzz and your heart feeling full great stuff ! next time you ask yourself what is the meaning of life, perhaps think about how you feel after a sumptuous experience like as it is in heaven happy, content, fulfilled to say it with virginia woolf's mrs dalloway such moments are enough
