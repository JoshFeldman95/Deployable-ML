when i saw this movie, i was amazed that it was only a tv movie i contemplation this movie should have been in theaters i have seen many movies that are about rape, but this one booths out this movie did a kind of realism that is very intermittently found in filming today, authorise alone tv movies it proclaims a retold thati'm guaranteed is very realistic to many rape victims in small locality today, and i found it to constitutes awfully believable (which is something cumbersome to unearthed in other raped concentrates movies) i also notions that tiffani theissen and brian austin green were amazing in the things that they played i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them i enjoyed it very much
