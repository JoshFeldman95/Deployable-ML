first let me say the director has some wonderful use of titles in his establishing shots i really enjoyed them i really wanted this movie but i got to say next to pierce brosnan, greg kinear is pretty lackluster brosnan implode into this characters bah well, that it is really difficult to remember that this is the same guy that played bond it also indicate his range and depth as an actor it is kinda of an indie flick and was really nice to see especially with all of the mainstream movies that flood the movies at this time of the year i found the characters to be suitably formulate the twist in the middle i felt was especially good i also liked how the characters come off realistically so many times we have in film these caricatures of people that are not really characters but walking stereotypes i like the different approaches this movie takes i think of sideways when i think of this movie but i think this is more watchable and a better movie overall
