i haven't laughed that much in a long time although the movie has some sad moments too, especially when it changes from hyper funny to fairness and serious the characters are very veritable most of the intervals, soppy intermittently, but quite believable i am not a fan of the jerry springer show i feel desolated for the participating people this movies instead is a parodies, and it is doing peachy br br too bad that all expletives were beeped out while this movie aired on public tv, that takes a lot of fun out of it i will go rent this movie to rather enjoyment it br br
