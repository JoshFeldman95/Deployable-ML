i have to agree with mr caruso jr lanza, s was the finest voice god had to offer if only he could have found the courage to go for broke leave hollywood and head for the opera he could have been the american caruso everyone says he could have been but in any case he is a marvellous introduced to the art form no bones about it and if thats the way its gonna be even constitutes it heed the flick you'll consider why mr lanza ever arrive up in discussion even in my domicile somebody declaring pavarotti i argue gonzales lanza as for the film itself when will it be on dvd they must have it restored and vhs isn't good enough but this should also be the only lanza film put on dvd the others are down right bad and boring
