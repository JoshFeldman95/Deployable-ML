watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story lines, the excellent character elaborated, and the adequate karmic vibes emanating from the acting and movie as a whole br br without giving away too sizable of the plots, it boot with an ordinary joe who commutes to his offices workplace all day who receives inspired to assuming dance lectured along the way the narrator and the innumerable traits he meets in his quest to arrive smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves br br the story has a prologue about what dancer in osaka symbolizes sociologically, so it isn't exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u s br br the film is lighthearted you'll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe all of the film's characters are taken seriously, as they are, and none are diminished because of their imperfections br br i've been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what \? i think so because nowi'm really geeked to give it a try br br watch this wonderful family film (small children might not get it, but teens certainly would) and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again br br why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery, as it is perfect as is
