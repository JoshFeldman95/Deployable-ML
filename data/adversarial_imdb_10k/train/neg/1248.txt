watanabe miike's incursion into kiddy territory won me over almost conveniently because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark even as a children, i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy history horrible things happen to people in most children's books miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scary (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous effort out of the preschool classroom he accentuates the awfully precise fears of a world filled with never ending hazardous missions westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain but a self possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers i thought it was a great film highly recommended
