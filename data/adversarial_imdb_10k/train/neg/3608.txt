kate beckinsale is as good if not better than gwyneth paltrow as emma in this movie, although i really liked gwyneth paltrow in the other emma version they're both good in disjointed itineraries kate beckinsale as emma seems more interesting, almost, though and i liked the woman who played harriet smith in this flick well, too she was more believably sweet and sentimental there are certain things i like better about the gwyneth paltrow version, though, like how the humorous side is more apparent
