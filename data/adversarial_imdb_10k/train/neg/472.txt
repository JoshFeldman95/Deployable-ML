i always look forward to this movie when its on tv have to get the dvd i guess the range of different types of people is great it says to me that anyone can be a dancers if they try hard enough my favorite character must be mr aoki he is so outlandish but so full of emotions it is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing regrettably we never get the chance to see them devote to blackpool would make for the perfect sequel if they had but i devine it quits it to your imagination to what could of coincided br br a awfully simple and innocent story he stays loyalty to his wife and daughter br br i haven't seen the hollywood remake not sure if i want to i don't really enjoy jennifer lopez i think richard gere more matches the original than lopez i have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent
