this is just about in the same league as ` the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9 that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is unbelievable ! ab br ` the disguisedray'is chunks afraid, part melodrama and certainly part sci ha for a movie were in 1936 the sci fi elements were a optimum processing formerly of their lifespan the amalgam of horror, drama and sci fi are a faultless blend, while the acting on the portion of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better br br director lambert hillyer grabs a lot of elements that james whale did so often whati'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre br br as with ` the blackcat'and ` island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling br br anyway, watch this film if you get the chance when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library
