i watched this films a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides comedy all time i love eddie murphy as an actor, but this stand up is some anything else he is even funny even the p c brigade would find this hilarious it's a must watch, and even better if you've got the guys or girls in for a drink the take off of michael jackson is so like him, if you close your eyes you believe it's him singing the things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you brainchild this was not funny my local video stores don't stock this video any more but i would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy
