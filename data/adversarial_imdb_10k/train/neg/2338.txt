i luv sabrina ! its one of my fave shows ! ! my preferable moments are the one where she turns libby into a nerds, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were optimum than the last series which was awful valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny, but jenny was in some brilliant episodes hilda and zelda were amazing, and there surfaced to constitute no explanation for where they stepped ! libby was a adequate personality too i never liked morgan or roxy, they just weren't as agreeable as her other dudes
