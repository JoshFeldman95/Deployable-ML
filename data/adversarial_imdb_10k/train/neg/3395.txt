the younger victoria is a elegantly garb and duplicated tad of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by jean marc vallee of stalwart julian fellowes'version of the infantile lass who was to become england's longest reigning monarch victoria much of the early component of the film, that chunks when victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (randa richardson) and sir john conroy (marked vigorous) seems to dragging and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations but once victoria (emily blunt) comes of age and is courted by prince albert (rupert friend) the film blooms blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to controlthe'childqueen' including her secretary lord melbourne (paul bettany) but as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing german prince albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining royalty with concern for the care of her subjects much due to the sensitivity of albert the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince albert's effect on the various royalties throughout europe ! it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend a solid if not transporting epic br br grady harp
