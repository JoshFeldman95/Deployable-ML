i did not like the pretentious and devalued apocalypse now probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter the deer hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war this movie is essentially deer hunter 2 the script is too loose compared to the deer hunts the storytelling is never developed to the point that the audience can altogether admit and feels for the characters like the deerhunter did the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the deerhunter this is why i can only give this films 7 out of 10 br br however, i think that the behaving was outstanding deniro and harris are truly amazing actors they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combatharris'character is a half dead alcoholic, who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his br br i also like the supporting cast everyone in the town is part of the movie the town obviously can't handle vietnam vets very well like many small towns, it is all about being quiet, humble, and minding one's businessharris'character, however, can't be any of these things it is interesting how wars effect people some people rebound quickly, while others never really recover
