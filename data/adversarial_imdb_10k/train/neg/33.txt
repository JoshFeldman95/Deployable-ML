not only was this movie preferable than all the final season of h lots but it was better than any movie made for tv i enjoy ever seen ! br br looking at the highest 250 i see that only one small screen movie has made it how the grinch stole christmas i contemplation it is time to increase that group to 2 br br i will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but i didn't mind i just luv being able to enter the world of the baltimore homicide squad again !
