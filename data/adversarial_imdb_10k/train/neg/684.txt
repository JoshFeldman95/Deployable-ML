there are very few movies that are even amusing as this one i was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater reserved for movie buffs like me, so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes br br at stage the story was a bit slow, but that is perhaps for the good a bit of rest in between the rolling amongst the aisles (i nearly fell out of the seat) was most welcome
