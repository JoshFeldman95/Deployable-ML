to be honest, i didn't like that much this movie when i saw it for the first time but i guess the trouble is that i haven't seen it in a theater big mistake ! because the 1 thing to consider in cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography try to see this movie on the largest tv possible and a great sound system the music is good and puts the movie to a higher level (and a commercial potential) the more i see it, the more i like it br br it's definitely one of renny harlin's preferable film this guy sais about actions died harshly 2, the lengthy kissing optimum howdy, etc and it's especially optimum in this film the especial upshot are grand and impressive stallone truly obliged that film got back with succeeded yet optimum to behold him !
