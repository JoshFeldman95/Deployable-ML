i remember having a pretty low regard for a venture like this when it was first released james not jim belushi, a hammy kid actress, and a cheesy title in a john hughes formula you couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago but, i got caught up watching it while wasting away a fri afternoon, and it hitting me on a couple of levels the fairy tale (part pretty woman, part reverse pretty woman), the very vulnerable, elizabeth perkins in miracle on 42nd street like performance by kelly lynch, the escapism over all, it marginally pulls some very nice strings it's pretty hard not to fall into the story, develop a crush on kelly lynch, identify with james belushi, dislike the stiff bad guy boyfriend, and laugh at the curley sue lines has all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it
