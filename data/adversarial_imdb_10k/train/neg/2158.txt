fast paced, outlandish, sexy, and unbelievable cagney is always terrific blondel beau you with her wit and energy it's obvious that this is a earlier censorship film by the innuendo in the script, the costumes, and the way they touch each other and bikinis before there were bikinis ! this is no holds proscribed fun for everyone i don't understand the john garfield issue though does it matter whether or not he's in this film \? if he is, he screen is so short that he's basically a prop you need to watch it frame by frame to even find him if he's therei'm a big cagney fan, but had never seen this one before i found it on turner classics i found it by wonderful accident sit back and enjoy the ride !
