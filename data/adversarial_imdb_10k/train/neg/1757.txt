all i can say is, first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors, gere and claire, and the story looked promising i have just seen it and i can sayi'm overtaken there are shocking scenes, true but that's what assumes it more realistic we shouldn't operate apart from our reality, these subject are happens suitably this moment and there are experts who are trying to modify problem and make issues better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i can't seem to feel the hollywood touch in the movie and that's what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles, and deserve a 10 from me
