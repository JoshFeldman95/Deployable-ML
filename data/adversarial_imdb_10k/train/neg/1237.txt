i grew up see this series i was about seven six annum old when it was on i increasingly reminders the 1st episodes which was called the new house it shitless the h ll out of me ! i can almost still hear that statues, laughing madly and the ending, oh my god ! the hooror spirit enters in the room for the infants yikes ! this was classic tv and it was a one of a sort series i had identified a dvds collection for sale on the internet 2 definately my question to any readership is anyone getting this set \? its a bootleg both sellers claim to have very good copy i have a sketchy and poor dvd of the new house episode, and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better, however, if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids a great series, clever, scary and daringly supernatural thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact, i'd love to discuss it chris walker
