i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 loved it then about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york (in tosca) until watch the ending of this film reminds me very much of that sizeable night what's not to like about this film \? the performer is sumptuous and pavarotti (done) was at his best and still looked great the story is actually rather funny in partsthe'food fight'scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful so was the song he sang if we were in love (one of the few times pavarotti sang in english) and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti kathryn harrold eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles br br i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today !
