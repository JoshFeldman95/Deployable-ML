from start to finish, i laughed real hard throughout the whole movie it's amazing that the groove tube is possibly the granddaddy, yet raunchiest, of all comedic skit movies this is the distances i experiences watching tv without being bored at flipping channels only to suffer from insomnia ! for 73 minutes, the weird, strange hilarity never terminates ! just think of how all this nonsense laughing can help you enjoy life easier ! it's way, way well than comedy central or any prime time show ! do yourself a favor and trash all those soft, lame romantic comedy filmmaking into the wastebasket ! better yet, tell your box office manager you want the groove tube back on the big screen !
