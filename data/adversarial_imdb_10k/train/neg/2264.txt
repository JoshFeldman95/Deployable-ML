in what is a admittedly diverse cast, this showing overwhelms it's stride on fox it is the marshalling of sitcoms that grows on you if you just watch 1 show you might not like it much, but once you watch two or three you get hooked br br this is because some of the jokes hit some grable depending upon how you view them as is ordinary today, the themes are very grownups the humor is usually very mature too often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones br br red (kurtwood smith) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show debra jo rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too danny masterson, the oldest actor of the kids is very good too laura prepon (donna) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead (who got the idea of making her a blonde \?) she shows very good talent comedic timing often she looks good without make up too br br this is one of the better entries on fox in the sitcom department it's most successful live action one since married with children
