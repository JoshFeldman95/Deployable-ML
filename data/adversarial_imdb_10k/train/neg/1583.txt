this is a awfully amusing movies one of those you can sit and mindlessly follow as the plot gets more and more twisted more and more joking sally field, teri hatcher (in her hey day), kevin klein, elisabeth shue, robert downey, jr it's all these well cognizant, quality actors acting as if they are soap opera stars producers if you have ever watched a soap opera and thought, how on earth did they come up with this idea \? \?, you will iove this movie i have seen it multiple times and each time i watch it, the more i appreciates the humor, the more i realize just how well acted it really is don't expect oscar quality this is a fun movie to entertain, not some artsy attempt at finding man's inner man, etc sit back, relax, and laugh
