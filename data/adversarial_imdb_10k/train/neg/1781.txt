endured this movie fri for the first time and powerfully adored iti'm a interns of screen writing and i iove the routed the negligible characters intervened just when something pivotal climatic entered in a scene br br i thought the dialogue was very flagrant and the theory of story is rather shocking at one particular point barbara stanwyck is openly flirting with her daughter's boyfriend and rekindling some passion in her husband whom she hasn't seen in ten years and with the gunshotsignal'two shots and then one'she hooks up with her old shag mate dutch (the reason she left town in the first place !) all at the same time ! the moral majority must have been totally incensed when they saw this flick back in the 50's br br love the costumes and cinematography and the straight from the hip dialogue just to watch barbara stanwyck and co doingthe'bunnyhug'is good enough reason to rent this film on dvd br br one of the best films from that period i've seen in a long time
