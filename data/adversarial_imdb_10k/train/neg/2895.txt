the main reason to see this filmmaking is warren william, who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager he is electric, constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters william is a great actors i feel he never got his due bette jenkins as his girlfriend also dazzles in an under written role personally, i found guy kibbee not quite right as the lame brained candidate that william and the others are trying to foist on the public he seemed more like an empty canvas than a person i would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non character the story itself is implausible, silly and cliched but warren william and bette davis are well worth watching
