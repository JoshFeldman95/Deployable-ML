this movie was very, very strange and very, very funny all of the actors are quite real and very odd the overall look of the film was different, too, sort of dreamy and bleached out, which only added to the spacey, fumbling, weird vibe of the whole thing br br it's not for everyone, i mean, it's not what you would call mainstream but that is what i liked about it it's although anything i have ever seen before erratic, with a outlandish overpowering and punch line in the dullest place the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy (and scabby) that you won't helping but feeling for them in other mots, these are vastly from hollywoodized copy of teens br ab all of, which for me, renders it a alright things
