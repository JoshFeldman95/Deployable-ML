in my idea, this is a adequate example of the movie that could have been much well if it had been short 10 years earlier i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies, but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70 br br the artists and animated did a gargantuan work in my thoughts, this movie can boast the best background art and one of the decent character design animated are extremely irreproachable and realistic for the duration of the movie you believe in the universal you see, so everyone did a great job it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, that beets typical anime girls with ease br br unfortunately, there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment first, the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and is really old fashioned by modern standards second, due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs finally, the setting is not so popular at the moment br br conclusion a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian, but not to a novel
