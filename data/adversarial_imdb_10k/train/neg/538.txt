am i the only one who saw the connections between the consider ofcamus'the myth ofsisyphus'and mary's life \? in camus version a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a giant boulder that he must roll up a hill unfortunately every time he reaches the top the boulder slips and ends up back at the bottom for him to start there may have been a buzzard pecking at his eyes,i'm not assurance right now in the movie mary spends her life struggling to get her life together, unfortunately every time she gains any footing she falls and loses everything case in point would be the party she throws where she gets intoxicated, offends her falafel lover, and is practically attacked by liev schrieber in case you question this theory, note how this scene ends with her attempting to climb a flight of stars while books fall from nowhere impeding her progress until ultimately she passes out the next morning when she awakens she is still on the stairs, never having reached the top
