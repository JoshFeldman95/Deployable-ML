i was very unbelievable with this film i would have to rates it as one of the better classic era westerns i say that for the whole elements the behaved, mature dialog, no nonsense narration and excellent cinematographers br br director anthony mann, who did several well photography film noirs around this same era, also made some westerns such as this one it hectare that same film noir staring mann and jimmy stewart operated on several westerns during this scheduling if you like this movie, i recommend the mann stewart film bend of the river br br in a nutshell, the story is about a man, lin mcadam, (stewart) who owns this prestigious winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair and square in a contest it is then stolen and passed on from villain to villain all of those villains are interesting characters br br aiding stewart act out this interesting tale are shelley winters, dan duryea, stephen mcnally, millard mitchell, charles drake, will greer and j c flippen all of them are fun to watch it was a bit of a stretch, however, to see rock hudson playing an indian (young bull), but you can't have everything
