the first episode i saw of lost made me think, i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but it's not like that, it's far more than that, because their is no monster at all and all episodes that you seeing of lost, well it's obtaining better every time a deserted island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed that's the real secret br br this series rules and i can't anticipation to know what's awfully going on there i hopes that they don't air the final 2 episode in the theatres, this installments deserve a 9 out of 10
