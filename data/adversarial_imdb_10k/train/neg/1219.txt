great voices, alot of adventure and clever dialogue creations this a too good movie the inserting of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more details and meaning, particularly the relationship between the older fellow, shadow, and the young hellraiser, options the earlier version of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive, which is done perfectly here sally soil is lovable in anything, but really shines in this film as the proud feline, sassy great bucked between kittens and dogs perspectives on life, and just the adequate tonnage of spirit and warm fuzzies to confer the plot and resolution excellent there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney
