this is a quirky little movie, and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well br br it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist, and is partly about following his sleep, partly about the dreams of others, and all about the travails of showbiz i thought the filmmaking was purty, and it acres a time or three of practical magic that creating the whole thing fecund ab brit alan arkin is unbelievable as the magician who never was, and his consultants of max make for a funny and afflicts relationship br br not for everyone, probably, but if you like movies about the journey, then i think you'll like this one
