this is the second baby burlesk short to be release, and definately the most popularity one, is a spoof of the 1926 silent film what price glory br br i watched this and i don't understand the kiddie porn that is being claimed it is just a cutie marginal film i have seen family shows that i grew up watching inthe'80'sand'90's that had little girls dressed more provocatively acting ina'mature manner' it was more provocative because they weren't dressed in diapers there's nothing provocative about a diaper unless you have one of those fetishes (just a joke) i read that description of the movie and where it states only a pedophile would enjoy watching this that is sick to me, if you watch this and are bothered by it, then maybe you need to look into your own psyche and try to figure out why it bothers you it is an innocent film that was made as a parody of another film all of the b b films were parodies, nothing more the parodies spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have true almost pornographic scenes and quite vile language shouldn't those be more appalling \? i can watch those without issue, but they sometimes take children's stories and turn them into filth on those parodies that is what should get under your skin not that they babified (not a word, i know) an adult movie from 1926, because we know how pornographic those silent films were, huh \? not to mentionthose'forbidden hollywood pre code era films'so vile and filthy they would never make such filth today \? (note the sarcasm)
