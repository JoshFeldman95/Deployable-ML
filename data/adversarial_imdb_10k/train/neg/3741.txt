i iove this movie i knew it would is chocked full of camp and absurdity like the original series i found it very heart warming to view adam west, burt ward, frank gorshin, and julie newmar all back together once again anyone who loved the batman series from the 60's should have enjoyed return to the batcave you could tell the actors had a lot of fun manufactured this film, especially adam west and i'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his batman costume had the script required him to do so i told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it now they wished they had i have all of the original 120 episodes on vhs now this movie will join my collection thank you for the reunion adam and burt
