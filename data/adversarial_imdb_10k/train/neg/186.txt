this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've yielded any filmmaking what made this movie so good for me \? constant action there isn't any stagnant parts, sizeable acting, smart writing i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just tabled it feeling like you are a parts of the scene finally, i becoming to staring an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i e there's no forced romance) br br i liked the first two bourne movies, but i iove this one br ab warning after watching this film, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car !
