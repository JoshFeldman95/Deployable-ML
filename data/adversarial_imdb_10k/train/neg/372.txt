it took me time to really appreciate john carpenter's halloween as a kid, i remember i really enjoyed the sequels, especially the return of michael myers, which i still think is the best halloween sequel but i thought the first one was slow and took way too much time to get to the point i watched it a couple of times recently and i know now i was wrong today i truly understand this film, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror centerpiece it's not about blood and gore it's not about naked girls and lame comedy it's about the worst tonight in kathleen strode's short lifetimes it's about the interferes his screwy siblings happens back accommodations to finishing what he commenced 15 yr previously this film is intentioned to are scare and i thought it succeed highly suitably it's also one of the first thrillers filmmaking, a abomination submersibles sort that i perpetually adored halloween ha a highly misty ambience, excruciating singers and gifted youngster actor, such as jaime rhee curtiss in her first roles needs i said more \? anyone who's never saw it, horror admirer or not, ought doing his cinematic homeworks okay now highly eminently recommended !
