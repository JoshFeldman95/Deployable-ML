i can remember seeing this flick as a kid in 1977 or 1978 hbo would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence back then it was unrated and was the only moviemaking of its kind ever shown on pay television especially back then i would sweetie to viewing it now as an adult where i would be more apt to recognising the adults thematic of it it was definately the next thing i had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 luckily i had stupid babysitters and party going parents on the weekends most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys breaking into houses to sniff underwear, feeding on a stranger's breast milk on a public bus, and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off a very racy film for theearly'70s until i checked imdb, i had no idea this movie had such a following most people i talk to have never heard of it
