' capitalcity'fans congratulating ! this first seasons of this serials is now disposable from networking dvds and i've recently ha my ripping ! although very sizeable an ensemble piece ofkey'maverick'trading floorcharacters'capital city'does underway we with various moments through both its first and second season when all member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line the cultural mix (english, irish, american, german, polish) of head salesman wendy foley's (played by joanna phillips lane) group of staff is counterweight with their own symptomatic mannerisms, interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and, to most people, seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf (richard le parmentier) and james farrell (denys hawthorne) i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthfulreclusive'freespirit'peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy, relaxed modern way of business become a reality to a certain degree wendy's (i am led to believe) immediate supervisor leonard ansen (john bowe) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupyingthe'middleground'on most occasions the main interest in the series, i believe, stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge's declan and the cool self assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann (played by trevyn mcdowell) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship fondness that they undoubted have br br looking forward to browsing through this title, and hopefully the second season of thirteen won't be too far away !
