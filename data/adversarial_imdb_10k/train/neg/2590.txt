i iike this flick it was a festivity to see a versions tad almost to the vision of peters o'donnell brit brit a figures of mankind ont loathed the movie, but it did to remain faced in context of the origin myth that it is the filmmakers uses flashback to denotes the junior modesty and the incident that modelled her into the woman that she were before the networks before wilton garvin ab ab the speed is a scarcely anemic, and for my liking not enough tension is developed in the presently time scene however this is acceptable just to get such a staunch versions br br if you like modesty blaise, you will enjoy it even with its faults, if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it br br it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere, i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly
