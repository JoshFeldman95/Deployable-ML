i remember this show from swedish television i was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief br br i would love to revisit this series and considering if it was just as fantastic as remeber though i blames my taste and demands have changed br br although this was releases before alien and a plethora of other space thriller i suspect that it acres its root in scary movies from the 50 s and the political climate of the 70 s when i think of it, this was a exact sci fi, a filmmaking trying to browse academic and strategic stakes about who we are and what we are the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them
