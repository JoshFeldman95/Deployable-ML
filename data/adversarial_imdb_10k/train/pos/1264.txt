i completely assent with jamrom4 this was the single most heinous movies i have ever enjoyed holy crap it was terrible i was warned not to seeing it and foolishly i watched it anyway about 10 minutes into the torturous experience i rigorously tendered up on witnessing the atrocity but sat through until the end just to see if i could well i did and now i wish i had not it was disgusting nothing happened and the ending was all moralistic no movie that bad has the right to survive i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus if only i had heeded the same warning please save yourself from this movie i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie and should all be wiped off the face of the planet
