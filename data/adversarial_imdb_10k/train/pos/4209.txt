as an engineers, i must affirmed this showing's first seasons beginnings out very inspiring most of the applicable math were tad imaginable, and the bonding portray between the eppes sisters and pa gave the show an interesting edge br br but after the first season, the shows started degrade, heavily most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very nonsensical to all people involved in science technology for real br br the involvement from the actors still feels okay and i can dunno a fair amount of money is still abandon into creating each episode, but in the end, this has degrade to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade c action thriller and csi style cop show br br if you are gonna watch it, go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second thereafter i would not waste my time myself, i gave the show up midway through season 3 br br season 1 8 stars season 2 5 stars season 3 3 stars br br let's sum that up to 4 stars since charlie doesn't know his math anymore, i won't bother with the correctness of mine either
