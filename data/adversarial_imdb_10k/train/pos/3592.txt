this film isn't severely good it's irritating, and not large bleeds for a terrifying cinematographic the plots just trods along with not multiple happening and i think the girlie vamps was so nonsensical she owns diverse chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her afterwards lighting like reflexes but, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them no wonder this went straight to cable br br final verdict not anywhere near as exemplary as the first vampire cinema you're a chump if you leftover your times on this
