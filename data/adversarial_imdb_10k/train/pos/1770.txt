i was not entirely impressed by this film it was originally named sin eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the recent half of the filmi'm not even sure what the first 20 moments of the film had to do with any of the stay of it it was very slower and what was with picks robocop (petter haines) as one of the vital actor that was a tragic point ab ab all in all i would affirmed check this out if you are into things dealing with the episcopalian credo but doesn't expect an exorcist or stigmata from this film it will surely flop after a few days and word gets out
