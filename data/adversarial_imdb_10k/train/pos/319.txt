if you're searching for a film that's fun to watch simply because you can creations humour about the not thereby splendid behaving, cheesy special effects, and typical sci ifs plot then this is the movie for you ! not at the acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually fairly decent the special effects weren't the greatest (to say the least) the animals looked completely computer animated there was an annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played over and over again throughout the overall moviemaking overall, a good movie if you're looking for something completely cheesy and fun to make fun of not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious
