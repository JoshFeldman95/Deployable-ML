i saw this film last weekend and it is silly and brainless an ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas \? the killed are scared senseless and can not run from a slower touching old man they downfall their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or, duh, burn him quentin surname mr fabersham of the honeymooners is married to diane brewster alias miss canfield of departing it to beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage wow, love plot the stays of the cast just follows both other in the mausoleum and suspense for shriek to react and run to their contribution the egyptian woman is not lousy looking but does not lend much to the film where is the mummy \? really just a curse unleashed this does not hold a torch to universal mummy films in the least watch this movie if you need sleep, because you will dose off
