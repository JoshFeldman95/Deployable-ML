some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever executed well, they are only partly right for me, this is the lamest movie ever made period ! i have never seemed anything equally basely vulgar, and attacking, and vile, and against humanistic nature as this film a faithful pity to the motion film industry, this isn't even so bad, its good there is no campy trashy pleasures to be had here like in some ofelvis'other bad movies like clambake this one is so decadent to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor cliched and stereotypical treatment here actually, perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars, seriously grade f
