this film was detrimental from the beginning the only tends of the films was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrific the killings were acted out very badly like when ally became reclining down that toilet i guess it was in the scrapped bunks but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other kinds are in the cabins you see alliance even angela must be faded in to acquired her the part that definitely got me was when the black girls and roberta were in the cabins and silvia brought the melodies chord and chocked her one it was heinous acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch \? ! \? ! \? then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her \? \? \? so stupid this movie sucked
