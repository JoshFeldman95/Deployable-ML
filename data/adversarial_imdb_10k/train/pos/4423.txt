a friend of mine was in the cast as a feds agent (a non speaking part, as i recall) he brought it over on dvd so i could see it it was interesting, but very much felt like an amateur cinematographic a well made connoisseur film, though really annoy and sorely crafted it was unmistakably fun to make and be involved in, but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release maybe in omaha they'd enjoy it, but this california girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement br br if this film maker has made or makes any more films, he really should try to have a really interesting story line, and good actorsi'm sure this was a great learning tool for them i wish them luck in the future, and hope they can improve their film making
