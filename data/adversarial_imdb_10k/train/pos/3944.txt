this is admittedly the shittiest films ever filed it is just to bad the name of roger corman is pegged with it i could've understand it in his timely decades when he had lower budgeted but today there is no excuses for giving birth to this !i'm a b movie pervert and from particular people point of view all the flicks i love are put aside by regular viewers but take my word on this one, vampire club makes the top of my rated of the best of worst it's hard to imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is totally out of place, the sound effects are just not effective and finally mr savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is toobad'cause he had a not to bad career over all let me knowi'fi'm to hard on this one cause when i don't like a movie i tend to forget about it's good side
