the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns christopher lee (who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved) is father pergado and gets to do his classic serious and scary customary the cast are not too bad, though most receives now retired from acting the film has heinous sound effects (mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and it insanely pondering at times shows a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band's assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it
