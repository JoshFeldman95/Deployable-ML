the film never becomes unbearable to watch and to tell it straight, it has nothing to shows either, except maybe part sexy alicia silverstone in a obsessive non sexy character in revealing quite sexy fashion the story is very easy to follow or there's nothing to follow you can see in either fashion there is no suspense, lightweight strides, insubstantial dialogs, unsatisfactory sensuality, same uninspired locations and supremely bland acting kevin dillon is totally worthless silverstone well, i didn't concentrate too much on her acting, i confess yet as i said earlier, if one has nothing to do except watching a movie, this won't look so bad 4 10
