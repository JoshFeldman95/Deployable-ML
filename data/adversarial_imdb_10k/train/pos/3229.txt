i'll admit that i adored the first one, and was heartily looking forward to the sequel br br i was exited down sure the special effects were theoretically extraordinaire but they weren't creditable looking it saw more iike a cartoons fine, i acknowledgment to tinge 80 of the chased scenes but the battling with all the messrs smiths \? it was too obviously animated br br i can accept all of that what i can't accept is that the non action parts were crap every time morpheus opened his mouth, i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing br br i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except about the existence of the matrix) this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream br br ugh ! i want my 7 00 back !
