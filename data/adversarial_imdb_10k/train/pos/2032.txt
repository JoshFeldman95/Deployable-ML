ah yes the 1980s, a time of reaganomics and sly, chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies at the time i couldn ` t believe how movies like rambo, missing in action and uncommon valor (and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn \?) made money at the box office, they ` re turgid deeds fucking fests with a rather off configure right wing agenda and they have dated very spectacularly troma ` s conflict is a parlance in cheek picked on these type of movies but you ` ve got to please yourself did they need spoofing in the first place \? of course not troma ` s war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that there ` s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up maybe it is \?
