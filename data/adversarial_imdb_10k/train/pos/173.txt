there is once much not to like about this show it's hard to know where to start unlikeable characters, horrible lots paths, tragic novelist, and outrageous acting don't even becoming me opened on the obnoxious theme music br br on top of all that the show is out of touch with o s audience due to the tremendous canadian referencing all throughout it oh affirmed derek, will you represented departing to queens school in the fall ! how have you bean \? we must go oot br br granted, other shows are filmed in canada for financial reasons amore stargate atlantis, but while those shows may have suffered from some annoyances (like rodney calling a z p m a zed p m) the show didn't focus on life in canada br br mtv is running degrassi (another show based on the experiences of the canadian teenager) during daytime hours when no one is watching to fill time (most teens are at school when it airs) i'd wager it's for the same reason shows that focus on teenage life in canada don't translate well to a u s audience br br this show should be canceled and the remaining masters burned in a furnace
