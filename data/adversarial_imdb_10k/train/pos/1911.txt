this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must es a conflict this movie have none it spent two times painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever spot any activity in it the picture tried to get artistic but overlooking to pay adoring to the fundamentals of story telling br br if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story there isn't one
