i am a big breather of low budget horror movies like this, but come on ! this has to have the worse piece of monkey s t i ha ever sighted ! i disregarded the reviews positioned on this places pondering that it would falls into my flavour in horror, but i achieved annoy and turning it off depart's embrace ab brit the wardrobes represented of cheap starred outfits and painters outfits from home depot the masks were made from what looks like tin foil br br the gore the gore was pretty good, i must give it that but ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget movie br br acting was horrible ! i didn't mind the dubbing i find this humorous like in ittenbach's premutos (great movie) the fighting and action sequences were pi poor br br bottom line don't watch any of schnaas's movies there are much better directors like jorg buttergeit and olaf ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter check premutos, house of blood, schramm and the nekromantiks
