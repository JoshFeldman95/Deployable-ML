1st watched 5 17 2002 3 out of 10 (dir ewald nicolas mulcahy) fairly crummy accounts of the titanic befall is the first videotaped version of this much heralded cas the replication of the disasters is not horrid, but the drama around it is at some times foolishness, spectacularly acted and way too soap opera like the story is very much the same as the most recent oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what james cameron was competing against (barely) in his recreation
