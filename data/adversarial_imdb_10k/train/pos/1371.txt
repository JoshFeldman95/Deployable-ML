grrr did this movie blow the characters were weak, the plots weaker i imagining this couldn't be too crummy because it has christoper walken, oops he must have done this since he was bored and needed the money the characters were supposed to be gaelic but noone had an irish accent i am spectacularly enticing to unearth something wonderful about this, i can't except walken does a fine chore with a teak characters discoveries something to reading, or see discovery, donen't ever see this films
