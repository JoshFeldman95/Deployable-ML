saw this movies when it first traveled out in the 1970's and hated, loathes, hated it ! easily the most booooring movies i enjoy ever seen in my life don't know where leigh attains his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you willingness to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate the title says it all because there are no saves moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people able to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you if you am nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this ! yes, leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss
