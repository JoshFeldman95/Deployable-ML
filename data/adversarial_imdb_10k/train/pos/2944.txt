the frst movie (dated 19 \? \?) did not show any monster, it just recommending scarier things, br br this version however shows every aspect of a sick minded ghost, including unnecessary special effects br br the mystery, as presented in the original movie, was the most scary part one simply did not know what was causing the weird things that arrival by showing the face of the old man, this mister has completely disappeared even greatest the special effects (crying wooden children faces) is ridiculous this is a stupid remake, too assuredly spectacular to even sont almost as scary as the original
