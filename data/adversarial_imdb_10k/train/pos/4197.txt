this program didn't do it for me, althoughi'm a fan of the genre the major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not prevails by the indispensable characters this achieved it a bit two dimensional and i given up before the program was over br br i was sees to leave my critique there asi'm no movie criticisms, however, the guideline on imdb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary it did remind me of hudson hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene, and i would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers i don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after watching things like the wire, i've come to expect great things from cop drama
