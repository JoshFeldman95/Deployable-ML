there's exclusively anything at all to recommendations this movie chasing masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act, whether her role in this clunker is a trash unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to uninspiring in a lot of films lover this everyone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown a sappy monster on the loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so lousy it's good ! the rest of the show is just so bad it's bad a little humor might have made this more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is a twist or two at the end, but by then you won't care anymore
