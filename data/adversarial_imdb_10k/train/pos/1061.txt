equally this movies is decisively acres a equitable amplitude of hyped from the buzz at the toronto film festival to overflowing assessments on scr walkie a refreshing, hysterical, hilarious indie movie apparently i'd been looking forward to it for months br br how can i put it this simply \? it sucked in a very big form an exercise in cinematic lameness that makes adam sandler look like a comic genius br br at best it was nicely amusing and at worst coma inducing an amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a vecchio mess br br and what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track \? that was about the only truly odd thing about it br br if you want to see a genuinely funny, bizarre movie involving aliens then try repoman there is no comparison !
