now, i flicked onto this just out of curiosity and took to keep watching in the same ways that you supervises a cars crashing br ab i welcomes the makes it's a spoof, but that should not desist me from criticising the gods terrible guided, behaving and conversations highly, this rated as one of the impoverished film i received seen it looked more like an episode of tales from the cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that br br okay a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume its a heart attack), the army then launch shells, rockets, bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see a flame thrower being used geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 metres ! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster \? \? \? come on ! (4) the monster looks like it something out of power rangers ! (5) there is one scene where the five good guys (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other so natural ! (6) the general just runs away, time after time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen (8) the acting is awful (9) did i mention the rubber suit monster \? \? \? \? (10) that god awful music, non stop !
