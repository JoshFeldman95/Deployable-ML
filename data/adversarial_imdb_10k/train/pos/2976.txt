let me introductory out by saying this flick was 1 funny comments at the supremely started with the exchange between the narrator and george monologue huh \? wait a minute ! who the heck are you \? georgie me nouveau georges studios too cheap to dividend brendan duncan narrator how did you get the part \? george newest george just lucky, i guess br br spectacularly, that's the only laugh chunks in the exhaustive film ab br it was still entertaining but then again,i'm easily entertained br br i wouldn't say this is the shittiest film i've ever seen (that title goes to the terribly un funny disaster movie), this movie falls 7 on my bottom 15 list br br if your a small child who is easily entertained, you'll enjoy this movie if you're a movie watcher who wants a good, funny movie, you'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one
