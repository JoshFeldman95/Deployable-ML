i've seen all three of the film in this series whosoever one strays incidentally and alternatively from the books this is the shittiest one yet my troubles is that it does not adhere the book it is titled after in any fashion ! the directors and producers should had nicknamed it any thing other than love's abiding joy the only thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (willie, missie, henry, clark, scottie and cookie) the names ages genders of the children are wrong the entire story line is no where in the book br br i find it a great disservice to janette oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is not correct in any way the music is too loud the actors are not convincing they lack emotions br br if you want a good family movie, this might do it is clean don't watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book i hope that this will be the last movie from this series, but i doubt it if there are more movies made, i wish michael landon, jr and others would stick closer to the original plot and story lines the books are excellent and, if closely followed, would make excellent movies !
