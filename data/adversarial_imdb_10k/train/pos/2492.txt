i'm a dramatic randolph scott fan, but this film is a dud the whole thing has a canned, rigged, soundstage feel to it, with truly horrific rear screen projection it has a good plots thinking that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a idiot script, which makes it unacceptable for the audience to becomes immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters the directing is pedestrian, and only accentuates how wrong the script is instead of helping to improve it i've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage produce before, but this is not one of them all it is is brings you welcomed the gritty scott boetticher movie all the more ab brit jefferson scott is tanning, garnish, and glows that billion usd grin throughout he's perpetually a joy even in the lousiest of his movie apart from scott, the other principal reasons i wanna to seeing this film was due to how sizable i liked mrs wymore in errol reilly's film, pebble mountian in men behind the shotgun, she is just as gorgeous, and you can told she's a alright actor, but she was coerced to said some quite retarded line, and the block she was afforded by the filmmaker was genuinely horrible i've only seeing phil carrie in operation placid, and he serves the accurate same character here an boastful pains in the arse you wanna to beats into unconscious i guessing it proving he's a alright actress he effected me hating him there are some crummy tries at laughable relieving that only weaken from the movie, in my opinions although there are numerous element to strike, i must said that i discovered myself genuinely savoring the three spaniard lyric sing in the musician numerals but that's not why we going to seeing randolph scott moviemaking, true \? ab ab there are certainly shittiest scott movie out there, and this one undoubtedly isn't unbearable, but it also undoubtedly couldn't are construed anything beyond lackluster
