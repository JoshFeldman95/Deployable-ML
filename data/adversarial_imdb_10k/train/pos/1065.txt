bob clampett's'porky's poorfish'is a so so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments set in porky's fish shoppe,'porky's poorfish'occupies an delicate area between a standardblack'n'white porky cartoon and one of the books come to life merrie melodies that were popular at that time typically of many of the early porky cartoons, porky is far from the star, appearing only in a rather prosaic opening musical number and the climax of the film for the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for unfortunately, the audience gets far less than they bargained for as was sometimes the case in the books come to life series, the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium laughs are scarce and, while the cartoon is just about saved by clampett's energetic direction, there is very little at all torecommend'porky's poorfish'over any of the other below par early porky cartoons
