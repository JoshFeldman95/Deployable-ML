this flick is unbelievably ridiculous i beloved terrifying movies, but this is the shittiest one i've ever seen i am a monumental fans of gore, but most of the fatalities in this movies aren't denotes it just highlights our the already perished organs, and the only mortality photos that they predominantly exposition in this flick are awful the visuals gaze then probably fraud the actors are horrific as so there is no actual emotions from any of them not only would i waste my time watching this piece of shh t cinema, but i received to subject myself to authentic film of animals being beat during the beginning of it if i could rates this a 10, i would e krone this film it's mess ab ab doingn't watched it
