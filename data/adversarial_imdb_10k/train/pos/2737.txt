i just saw this at the 2006 vancouver international film festival the synopsis in the festival guide called pretty good so we decided to check this one outi'm sorry to say i was very disappointed br br besides being poorly authored, it was uninspiring i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could ca with this inauspicious script br br first bite was clich√© without being ironic, over the top seriousness without being comedian the movie would have been finest had pursues hoe went with a campy horror feel yet he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a uninspiring cinematographic i can't recommend this film it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
