let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable, particularly from down argentine way, but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got round and frankly the whole films was an pity costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was pernicious, the coloration good, and the films tremendously too extended it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success the music score was woeful, and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way as i was such a fan of miss grable, i always wish i had never seen this one !
