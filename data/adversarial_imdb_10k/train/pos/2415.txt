this was an excellent thinking and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it concluding it seemed like a uninspiring set it off respects the west the plot barely made any sense there were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities there were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't pertain to the plot nor become it help further the story along there were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations the script should do made more sense as well as the directing i had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie but the casting was great in my opinions if you're only watch for eyes candies then this is the film for you
