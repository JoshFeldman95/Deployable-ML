this italian film fromthe'70's is not even in the class with dog soldiers, the howling, or even that awful american werewolf in paris, but it is fun to watchi'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit we're talking about graphic, complete nudist it's obvious that she is a real blonde humma humma humma ! ! the story is a hoot, the sfx are childish, and the behaving (for the most part) stink the only redeeming values of this movie is all (and there is a lot) the nudity sex scenes tame by hbo standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on saturday night ok here's the spoiler there is no werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine (\? \?)'s ancestor the girl just imagines that she's a werewolf in other words, a clinical lycanthrope
