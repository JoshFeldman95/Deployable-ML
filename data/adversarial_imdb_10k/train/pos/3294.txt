i guessing it was an underrated pg 13 damn ! at least brittany icy's performing was exemplary and some others like idris elba were adequate too, but some others juvenile in the prom like the leads friends were not that convince the murder was well dumb and looked so stupid too the deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginals the flick was rather bored too and rather inflated it wasn't suspenseful at all, i almost decrease sleepy its another bad pg 13 remake, its definitely a loathsome moviemaking imo the ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and blunt the flick is pretty anemic too overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe brittany snow i think she gave a good performance and idris elba too, but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake well thats just my opinion i gave it a 2 10
