i did not expecting much from this film, but dude o boy, i had not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not outlining a allright behaved here, you won't find the emotions that his caracter is real, i think the movie would have been a bit better if it's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it in the making of they don't reveal a peculiar smile this is a very negative film ! i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me, but i did never laugh !
