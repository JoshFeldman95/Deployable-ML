to the small disenfranchised sighted here praising this film get serious i know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish until shitty it does not deserving to be part of this franchise i can only guess those tells how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are desiring to give their career a push poor in every way, don't con people by saying otherwise storyline is a weak remake of the previous entries, scripts is likewise attempts to hide the omission of originality by using a girl instead (wow !) don't disguise the film makers lack of ideas, and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares absolutely no redeeming qualities, utter utter turd i've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame
