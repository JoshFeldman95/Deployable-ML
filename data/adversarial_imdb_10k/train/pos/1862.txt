this is not very a zombie film, if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around here the protagonist, armand louque (played by an uncommonly young dean jagger), soars verification of a method to creating zombies, though in realities,his'method'is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into mesmerize slaves this is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more truly by fritz elongated in his series of'drmabuse'films, including'dr mabuse thegambler' (1922)and'the testament of drmabuse' (1933) here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancee, claire duvall (played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo, dorothy stone) which is really the major theme br br the movie has an intriguing beginning, as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there at some type of compound (where we get great 30s sets and clothes) he announces his engagement to claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal, clifford greyson (robert noland) it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact this would have been a great moviefor'mystery science theater 3000', if they hadn't already roasted it br br it's never shown how louque actually learnsthe'zombification'secret, but he then uses it to kill his enemies, create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards we won't see such sheer force of will until john agar in'the brain from planetarous' (1957) br br finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives uphis'powers'to gain her love, he does so, causing the'revolt'of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him greyson embraces claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad br br so really then, it's not that bad of a film, despite the low imdb rating it currently has on repeated viewings (\?) one can see the artistry in the well formed script ! dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness is that really his own hair \? we remember him more for his bald, old man rolesin'whitechristmas' (1954),'x theunknown' (1956)and'kingcreole' (1958) the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better, earlierfilm'whitezombie' (1932) in which hapless robert frazier (as charles beaumont)uses'zombification'to win the love of madge bellamy (as madeline parker) br br if you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds !) i'd startwith'whitezombie' (1932),'king of thezombies' (1941),'i walked with azombie' (1943),'night of the livingdead' (1968),'the last man onearth' (1964) and its two remakes in the modern era of classy films, thereare'horrorexpress' (1972),'the serpent and therainbow' (1988),'28 dayslater' (2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many, others too numerous to mention br br this one is not really a zombie film judging this movie on its own terms, it's more of a semi gothic romance as such it ranks a little below some of universal's bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s so i'll give it a 5
