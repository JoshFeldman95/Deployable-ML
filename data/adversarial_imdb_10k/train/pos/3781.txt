this movie was almost intolerable to session through i can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is invoked to ranging over weeks in time yet the character don't once change outfits, but the acting broke the 4th wall to corners for me i've spotted better acting in a 4th grade play aside from that the plots is unrealistic if the man suspected the guy he would enjoy turns him in i was also powerfully unsatisfied that all the killings were done with a glock what kind of gore is that that is not a copied the zodiac have not kills using just a gun the authorities would have known it wasn't him another thing that really bothered me was that they called disassociative identity disorder dsm 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder overall i think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at easy rider that had dennis hopper and jack nicholson and a low budget
