i saw this film awhile back (while working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was horrendous hewitt is frail at best, hopkins phones his performance in (but still blows away wilkinson in their scene together) and alec looks bored trust me on this you shouldnt dissuade this film like the plagues if it ever gets released it seems to will on steadily as the unmotivated plots suspenseful at a snails's pace it is relentlessly comedic, the cinematography is friggin and the direction is pedestrian alec baldwin should budge to film school if he plans to direct again in terms of his behaving, his characters is completely egomaniacal, which renders it impractical to rooted for him daniel ackroyd is sweet bizarre and the astonishing composition of the jurors alongside the movie's terminates is adorable, but this movie is just straightforward horrible
