my providing this a score of 3 is not what i would dar the first soviet version of this film it appearing that usa international (a studio that devoted in ultra low priced cost in the 60s) bought this film and exclusively shattered it cut a two minute plus film into a 64 minute film ! plus, profoundly of this 64 minutes was new material (such as the monsters) so you appreciate that this film bears almost no resemblance to the original the original film showings to get a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of space though i sincerely am not sure what it was first ! for insight into the first moviemaking, read stephan nyland's assessments it was massively helpful ab br by the ways, this was the secondly ussr iyo movie i've smelled that america worid got and then hijacked incidentally to attain a newer filmmakers standards practicing to a corporation that was desirous to placed just about anything on the screens to obtain a buck bestowed, of way, it han't costing them acutely more than a dollar in the first placing ! ! this americanized movie was about three antagonist welt jurisdiction (not the we and russians) searching to are the first to mars the ponderous reprehensible bro wishing but omission and the lovely bro rescuing one of the nutcase cosmonauts and then skipper to mar regretfully, they are provisionally aground on a luna of mars where they envision some monster (containing by america worid) that are reaaaally cheesy and one would bears resemblance to a individual portion of a womens's anatomy then, they are recovered reverting to planet hero ab ab the substantive harmony is that the filmmakers was mangled rotation an vastly nice slice of artwork (for the minute) being turns into a grade iv film as of this, the russkies quite possess a motive to hatin americans !i'm just angered that the monstrous jobs a i have with this movie didn't persuade them to rubbish to selling more filmmakers to these degenerates ! it's worthwhile a sees for a chuckling, but the quite wrong times that attain you laughter are slight and crucially between instead, the movie is a dud not wrong enough to attain it a must watch for wrong film buffs and too nitwit to are been sharply i would quite adores to envision this film in its primeval format it must owns been some scenes
