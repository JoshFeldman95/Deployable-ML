the closing song by jonny tok was the only gargantuan matter about this films spectacularly that is all the affirmative i can say about this western films i gets to writing 8 more lines for my remarks to be posting, but there is more than 8 lines of horrid in this western i am not certain if the movie was a tribute to hopa along, or just a spoof the heroes and the backstabber in this film were too plastic not real at all a lot of the supporting actors in this movie revisited authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke a above commentator insights this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at president bush this was not a democratic or republican western it was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially i wonder if it made any money at times i thought i was watching a movie made by college movie students if that was the case, then it was a great movie
