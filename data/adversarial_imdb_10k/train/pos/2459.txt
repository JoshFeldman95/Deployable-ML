i am goes to keep this short this adaption of the wonderful king literature is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and, as a result, this movie has miraculously find its way in the top 250 ab brit jack nicholson is nonsensical as torrance and so is shelley duvall the saga, that haya nothing to do with the book, is an incoherent clutter and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes br br my advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series br br oh, and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is not a good writer should stick to reviewing masterpieces like eyes wide shut
