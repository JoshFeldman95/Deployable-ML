i watched the entire movie recognizing the participation of william hurt, natascha mcelhone, and desiree nosbuschi'm glad that i had no idea of the presence of peter weller at the end of the movie i affirmed that was peter weller \? kudos to stavros weller for an outstanding performance weller played a major character, and his performance was such that i didn't even recognize him br br overall the plot was baleful, the writing was crummy, and the performances, aside from those of nosbusch and weller, were subpar the scenery and setting were interesting, and weller was amazing br br 4 stars, of a possible 10
