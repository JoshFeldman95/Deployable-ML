i just ended readings a book about dillinger this moviemaking was fantastically incorrect it's like they could a recorded of naming and just made everything up his stickup and escapades were quite plans, down to the second when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not they had notes of every road, where to turn, etc purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left hodges never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed, only pictures of him the way his gang members died were fictitious dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie if i had never read the book, maybe i could have enjoyed the movie the acting was a bit over the top in places the action was overdone as well on second thought, i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book
