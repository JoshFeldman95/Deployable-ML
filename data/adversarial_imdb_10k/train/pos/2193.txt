i carried to admire this movies with fairly fewer anticipated, figuring it would is a magnificent chunks of fluff unfortunately, it wasn't even that i could barely sessions through the film without longing to walk out i visited with my three kids (ages 10 and 13) and even they kept asking, how much long \? after prolonged until the ends, i just kept urged who would approve this script even the reliable fred willard couldn't save the frivolous dialogue, the states jokes, and the vacuous plot i'd suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie (i use the term loosely) should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class at the least, there are many books on directing, screen writing, and producing movies that would teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing
