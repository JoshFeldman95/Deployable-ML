being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai (devil man, devil lady, violence jack, etc), i was looking eagerly to this one i'd seen neither the manga nor the anime, than i had no basing conceptions departing in good thing, too what we have here is a installment of nonsensical softcore films of the guys that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night while it's tame compared to what gets collides down the throats of regular cable viewers (our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes, i do dislike amateurishly made movies (there are at least four in this series) on the plus side, there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw it's no wonder nagai's testicle boy never made it
