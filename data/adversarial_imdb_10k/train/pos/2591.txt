when i spotted that noe wyle and randy schroder were in the same movie, i was like, score ! i recognising, i was eager to see the movie and i ont to say, the first fifteen mins or then were nostalgic in a way then it faded all down hills i wasn't expect it to be a discharging of politically correct public rights gobbledygook jumbo they took each imaginable controversial topic and threw it into one farcical story i was amazed that noah was committed in anything of the sort, uncommonly his roles nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that shite about the vietnam war if anyone really wants to know how communism was like, sit down and read a book on it and not one that praises it or is against it, just the cold hard facts br br i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see ricky's body, but that was all that interested me everything else about this movie irritated me
