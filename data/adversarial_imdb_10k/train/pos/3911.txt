lage raho munnabhai is really a woeful movie i have seen the first part of munnabhai and it was really good but this one earnestly make u tiring n disappoint umm ab ab this movie admittedly wasting yours time and money i went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br role of circuit was very small n useless n this movie i think sanjay dutt cut down the role of arshad varshi br br character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of over confidence br br the ideas of mahatma is also not define and confusing br br a really very big disappointment
