i like end of days movies i like d films i was desired i would like this movie br br i could ignore the poor effect, the often heinous music, the cringe inducing lines i could ignore the inexplicable events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter i could ignore the fact that the peoples who battleground famine and prosecuted to come worlds truce are the bad folks none of these things kill the movie what reaps this movie is that it's just lowland and simple annoy nothing actually happens almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the moviecreators'morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense br br if you're looking for an entertaining b movie, look elsewhere this movie is just boring
