i very much looked forward to this movie its a good family movie however, if michael landon jr's editing team did a better job of editing, the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context i do hope there is another movie from the series, they're all very good but, if another one is made, i implore them to take better care at editing this story was all over the putting and wouldn't gaze to obtains a centre which is tragic as the other cinema of the series were wondrous i enjoy the story of willie and missy they're both great role models plus, the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy a good love story
