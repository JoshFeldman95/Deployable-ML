except for acknowledging some nice cinematography, i can hardly say anything conducive about this films the single real issue is the protagonist's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life abundant emotionally powerful scenes don't go with this plot and, because of bad acting, they also betray to create the intended atmosphere the filmmaker only manages to introduce anthony's dilemma and eventually brings an easy resolve the characters don't seem to evolve, although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for sonny beside him, actors don't get to play much and when some of them have to, they come off as self indulging amateurs i wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script, throwing away all the potential of the plot, or the bad acting, disturbing any appeal that might be left
