unlike many, i don't find the premise or theme of this show the least tad offensive its fulfil, however, is another matter keenly like so many b minus movies, all the decent gag appear to have been splicing into the trailers for most of the 22 or so minutes we sit in cutback anticipation any morsel of real humour or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers with a couple of exceptions the acting is heinous the comical over emoting and gesticulating of some cast members potentials is well suited to a late night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a canadian one) notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, i cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the cbc to replicate the success of corner gas unfortunately, they got the tone and the script completely wrong for the prairies the final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (why \? are they so hard to find in saskatchewan \?) did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown regina exteriors \? as a proud canadian i hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the cbc's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom
