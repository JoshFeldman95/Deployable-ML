this film is another example of the cataclysm of mideast asia moviemaking two or more separate stories layered into one film other reviewers has definitively picked up on it as well because there are several mentions of the first part and second part how can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time \? i was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn't end, it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an mundane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow !) i look forward to the day when wong kar wai is given a decent script to work with !
