i think it's time john rambo move on with his life and seeks to put vietnam behind him this series is getting old and rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer ever time he towers up on the screens nobody deathbed vietnam was not a pleasures place to be and frankly i am tired of hollywood making it seem like it was this is not the finest of the films concerning vietnam, that honor goes to jon waynes green berets in any occasions giovanni rambo carrying around a 50 cal machine gun taking on what seems to be half of the viet cong army plus a good varied russians is an insult to watch what is worse is rambos cheesy speech at the end please ! ! oh yeah i heard they are making another one
