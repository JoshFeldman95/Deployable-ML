why achieve all movies on lifetime recieve such lethargic qualifications \? an unexpected love ooh, how provocative ! ! this much i know would have been better the film is nothing special real people don't really talks like these characters do and the situations are admittedly hackneyed the straight woman who turns lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character if you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion, you may enjoy this although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people why am i extravagance my time writing about it \?
