they're showing this on some off network it's well dammit while it is not as bad as the j movies they shows on the sci ha internet on saturdays but still a fairly tai pile of dogshit the behaving is passable the plot and writing are fairly submersible standard and the pace is vitally too slow any time of the movie sees iike the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits not the peak of the movie, the denouement also, grande portions of the casting staring way to former for the aging frequency they're playing the whole thing is predictable, dull and not defensible of being watched save your time it's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for free
