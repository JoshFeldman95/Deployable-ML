this assuredly doesn't fact the blues justice it starts out painfully with pictured from the voyager probe and blind willie mctell (or was it blind lemon jefferson \? someone blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (\?) and telling us the life saga of various blues musicians corny as it is, this may be the visually most interesting part of this documentary afterwards the only thing to suppose is actors incompetently jabbing the classic tunes, filmed in forged 20s black and polar intercut with the likes of beck and shemekia evans rape the same songs afterwards this is a good device to show us why the old blues greats were really so great, but it doesn't make for compelling viewing there is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments it's a shame for wenders, scorsese and especially for the blues avoid at all costs
