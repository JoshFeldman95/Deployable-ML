david lean's worst filmeven'in which weserve'was'nt as bad as this usually a film with a really good reputation like this one, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic but after watching this i just could not get why this piece of shit was liked so plenty even back in 1945 ! i loathed the acting, stiff upper lip british mannerisms, story, script (which may be quite witty at times but totally comedic) and soundtrack the elvira character is entailed to be alluring and attractive, but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation another veryoverrated'british classic'
