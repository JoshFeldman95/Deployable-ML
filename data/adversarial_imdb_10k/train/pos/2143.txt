james gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this primal of hilarious rubbish affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it, the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable i saw this in the usa in an empty theatre, i soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes i walked out before the end it was so horrid, so envision my surprise when back in england i sawthe the movie haya a glowing report from that yoyo paul ross in one of the down market sundays i always rely on ross to save me money on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, i get straight on this very website to check it out this movie should have gone straight to 1 99 dvd in a supermarket near you
