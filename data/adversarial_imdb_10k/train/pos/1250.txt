i can't believe anyone thought there was anything original or spectacular about this moviei'm a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and i can enjoy even oldest filmmaking with comical premises as long when they are written by someone other than a monkey (see, for example, my glowing review of altered states 1980) br br a monkey could have explained better exactly why i should for a second take seriously the basic idea behind this movie the matters is not that the creators took a faint budgets it's that they can't care br br now, to publicly humiliate the vain magazines whose glowing reviews appear on the box br br chicago tribune br br san francisco chronicle br br san francisco bay guardian br br (actually, i enjoy reading the latter two still, their movie reviewing credibility has gone through the floor but i know if i ever make a movie with handheld camera, a cheesy plot and stupid effects, i'll show it to these journalists and remind them what they said about conceiving ada)
