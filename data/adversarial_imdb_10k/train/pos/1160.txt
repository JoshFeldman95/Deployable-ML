this film was a stupid piece of crap negative everything why is it that we who love western movies achieves heartbroken nine out of twelve moments when rents westerns it seems that if you don't see names like robert duval, kevin kostner, or tom selleck attached to the cover, it isn't worthwhile messed with for the most portion the main action of shiloh falls was takes placing in 1892, yet the revolvers used were 1860s idealized even the shooting was bad in one scene the marshal fanned his six shooter about nine times and couldn't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away i had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the sunset carson school of acting
