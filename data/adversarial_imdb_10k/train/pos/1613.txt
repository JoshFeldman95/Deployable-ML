the good i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me the acting wasn't too bad, and the cupid killer was believable and disturbing br br the bad the story line and lots of this movie is fantastically weak there just wasn't much to it the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting i don't suggestions this movie to anyone who can not handle gore br br overall a good freaked, but a bad story br br out of
