the film is pretty confusing and comical the plot is awful but on the plus side the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rants sharon stone is ok this time not even half as good as the original mind you the murders aren't as gory as the first one either, which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed) the script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and washburn are highlights the plot twists a scant time, but the concluding is horrible the tension is perpetually continuous with a enormous butteredof'oh my gods !' the chasing sequences are magnificently oriented, and gunfire and camera angle are incredible and brings a scant of classes to an otherwise, rush viewed movie sharon pebble is a bites older for this too the bits where we staring her bosoms were, in the first one, delights this times around, they are too awful to describing the movie its self is somewhat averages, but it is worthwhile a go predominantly as the movie would deserve some alright buzzing with the beginning sequence being a highlights not to are vital, but if you enjoyed the first one leaving this one doesn't ruining the runs you'll are appreciative you exit this boulders unturned
