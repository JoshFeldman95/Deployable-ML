i have never seen the 1973, older highly rated version i am a nicholas cage fan (by the way, fine acting as usual) this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot (i can see it being completing on a blend napkins at a lunch parties), if you won't figures out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will definitively get this movies entertaining this is, of late, the terrible rut that hollywood seem to gets enlarged for itself with the horror mystery thriller genre, vulnerable to give the viewers enough credibility and authored a soft, adept, and tantalizing screenplay, they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater at least, it didn't have the jiggling hand held camera syndrome
