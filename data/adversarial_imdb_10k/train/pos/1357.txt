basically, cruel intentions 2 is cruel intentions 1, again, only poorly done the story is exactly the same as the first one (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions the cast is more unnamed, and definitely down capable instead of being seductive and portraits me into watching it, i ended up sentiment dirty so it comparisons to noting a soft baseline pornographyi'm not confident whether to blaming some of the moronic line on the actor or the editors and i often feel bad saying that, as i knowed how hard it is to do both but it was usually a three hrs wasting of my lives it literally amazes me that some movies get made, and this is no exception i can't believe they'd make a third one
