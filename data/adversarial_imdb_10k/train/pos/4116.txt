camera work why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy \? this is disturbing and disturbing changing the flashes of the still pictures were way too little many of the other scenes were too short also just flashes sound the background music was way too fervent and covered up the voices one necessity not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said doesn't everyone checking these things and make them do it over again please lighten the volume of the background music in future is adjustment of the relative sounds levels the job of the writing, julia wong \? the plots had distances too many loose ends the basic story line had potential i think the film needed more work was it rushed \? perhaps they ran out of money like a lot of movies, it started out great but just petered out toward the end i really don't understand this, you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn't all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard br br sorry to be so critical
