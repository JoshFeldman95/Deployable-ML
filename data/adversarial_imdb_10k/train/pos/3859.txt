i've now crafted review for many of the moh episodes, and this is among the lamest an interesting premise at the beginning is exclusively abandoned by the time the credits roll if watching people things they never would in real life amuses you (let's check out the basement !), then this is your show except, it's not joke or entertaining it's just annoying br br the extent of the virus is never, ever showed i can very much underrate the fact that it affects men only, as the resulting situation is immensely, uncommonly frightening but then things escalates as daughter lets obviously deranged dad into the home, and ultimately dies at his hands the woman flees north, and runs into a few tens situations then, some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her (things that make you go huh \?) or something then, she is huddling for warmth the end br br awful these directors are mailing this tripe in
