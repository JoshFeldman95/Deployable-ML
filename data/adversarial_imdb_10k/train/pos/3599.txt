i only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me the flick maintains immensely meagre if any intrigue and seems to be nothing but continuous scene of moody sadistic violence and deeply lightweight of anything else i yearned to see this movie because it starred zoe trilling of the second night of the demons and i wanted to see her playing someone normal spectacularly, the tobe hooper scripts barely begins and goes nowhere as roberto englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot zoe, i know where you are now hiding from this film !
