this is one of the worse films i have judged presently when a males says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself i pretty plenty consider the movie to se in the mastery of playfulness 14 years old male fantasies the bed room scene was over the top and cutback an intimate instant into a deluding of biological functionality seeming to traversing gas in public from the first any other scenes was a chat about how little sex they where getting, how long its been since they got some, when their next sexual liaison will be, and with whom it should be with on top of that the dialogues and acting was very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here please, don't even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it
