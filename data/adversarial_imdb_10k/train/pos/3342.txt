although properly warn i actually sat down to watch this film in proportion for i uniquely brings each film an even breaks, and as i imagined that a only movie couldn't be that bad i gazebo corrected not even george kennedy, barry bostwick or bin stein could save this turkeys from sinking like a ton of bricks only once during this humor forsaken hilarity of a bogus had i laugh namely during the simon says scene the other joking are either unfairly provoked out or simply plain unfunny and some of them you actually see coming a mile away this film just holdsn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane ! (i ii), naked gun (i ii iii), or scary movie they all had a funny gags, b good dialog and most important of all c unforgettable quotes men in white has got d none of the above to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement avoid this movie anyway you can ! consider yourselves warned !
