unless somebody enlightens me, i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but it s enormously from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and, that s basically all when that agent is played by pacino, one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and blunt this movie is to one of the best protagonists in the world, el deniro, this is the second movie of the year (the other is simone) that deserve the title the most gruelling and the most insignificant motion pictures of the years instead, what s gonna on, al \?
