because if i was, i may has hoping it was me being crucified on a wooden cross !i'm nevertheless trying to assess the plots of this films andi'm being lavishly that there was even a plot to boot with as lately talked, it's a misnomer on the coverage of the bluray that richie dreyfuss is definitively the celebrities he was rarely in the moviemaking and if he was indeed frustration as the back covers described he was, well, that's undoubtedly since he said yes to become in this havoc of a movies and couldn't get out of it ! the movie really seemed to focus on jared martin, and what his role in the movie was supposed to be, other than the extreme close ups, was not as big of a mystery as to what gene barry's role actually was or wasn't and speaking of big whomever had the bright idea to fit gene barry in the humpty dumpty attire, which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober i could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was, from the dialogue not matching theactors' mouths (think clutch cargo), to the erratic jumping from scene to scene (again, being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes), to the lack of a plot however, if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a cottage in michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid cat pictures, i recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day !
