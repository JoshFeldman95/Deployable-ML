just saw the movie this past weekend, i am upset, and unsatisfied with it foremost, the film tells you that immigrants, the ones from former soviet union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what americans have been working for which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a largely weaker way of telling people about it that's the main thing another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs the actors ha pretty well, but it wasn't up to them saving this fanfare of shits a few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money back
