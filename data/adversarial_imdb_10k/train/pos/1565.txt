i began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s k novel (a novel i never read) br bri'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested what admittedly staggers this story down is the cooperates done by the director and the actors the film is overlong, hasn't no resplendent shots and no terrifies, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are damn br br the only things best are that, as i said, it keeping you interested (i guessing the book must are alright) without utilizing sizable horror cliche ab br my votes 4 10
