the only rationale i rentals this was because of the stipulations in fangoria revue the article made this films gazing enthralling well, it isn't this was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie all the actors in this movie are heinous, except faye beals, who is necessarily a joy to watch but too much time was focused on gina phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and duilio marzio marzio has such a rough argentinean accent, you can only understand every confrontation of words he exposes also on hand is nicholas pauls, who plays the ultra bland love interest to gina phillips the bottom line this movie is not scary there is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie i would have given this one star, but i gave it three just because i like faye dunaway so much but even she wasn't that great in this
