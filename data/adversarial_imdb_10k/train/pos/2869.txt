we all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often wins nothing but our deepest revulsion maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasn't terribly unimaginative, even for a slasher flick fairly much, the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to reminisce as you'd expect, they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april 1st by means of electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer i've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie
