this movie wasn't that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original it's directed by martin kitrosser of friday the 13th fame the acting is very bad indeed, but the gore and special effects help make it riveting kno one thing i like about screaming mad george (make up effects artist for the film), his effects are so off the wall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a inauspicious movie just to find out how crazy they're gonna get the movie isn't really all that gory, but there is an extremely nasty eyes savoring scene in the mid implicating a toy worm (what ! \? !) micky rooney renders a invited semblance that he presumably wasn't too passionate about but requisite the cash at the time, potentially \? if you enjoyed the wierd 4th installments (my favourite of all 5), you'll presumably like this one i enjoyed it brighter than the matrix ! enjoying
