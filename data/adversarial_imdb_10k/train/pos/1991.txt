i really tried to like this movie but in the completes it just becamen't work for me i have seen most of kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity however, these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive the plot is cool if not all that original and could enjoy made for a pretty ace film spectacularly, the pace is painfully slowest and the film takes an age to get going, before get fairly predictable places the action is just about presentable, with the final fight pretty neat, and the early one about allright the early one is also marred by overspeedy cameras working, doing for fewer coherency there are some groovy audiovisual impact and some fascinating thoughts drifting around in the dialogues but the movie yet tosses sorely the characters are neither suitably fleshed out nor suitably action and the settings and extensive colors plan is uninspiring and bore the movie is not totally dreadful and ha some dots of interesting, maybe logical utilizing of the quick forwards buttons could improving it with about twentieth mins took off the running times this could are a quite presentable sci fie thrillers but the sincere duration movie is dreary only recommend to highly malady and decide kitumura fan
