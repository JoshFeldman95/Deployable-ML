this is probably one of the shittiest movies i fi ever judged the occasions in it are completely randomness and get slight or no sense the realities that there is a sequel is yet sickening i may inbound down with a events of cabin fever (i'm again appologize) i demonstrates it as bugs being smooshed to a newspaper so it emerge to viens innumerable slices of aspect mixed collectively f gram kev the pancake compassion karate boy is just freakishly weird on its special, then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted, then the drugs addicts, then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth, even that did not make me like this film hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do boycott cabin fever 2 ! ! ! ! !
