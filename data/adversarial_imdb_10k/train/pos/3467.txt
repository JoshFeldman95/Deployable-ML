' sayyes'is one of those flicks that you keep awaiting is going to get better, but it never does it's the kindof'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocentcouple'crapfest, accordingly beloved of straight to video film makers br br the dialogue is hokey and, in several places, rotten translated the acting is cohesive rotten, especially from the villain of the piece, played by joong hoon park he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple br br the plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all beliefthe'heroes'don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill themthe'heroine'twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her the villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving the villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries and don't even get me started on thatterrible'twist'ending sheesh br br the only plus point in this film, for me, is sang mi chu who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress br br overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt tocopy'thehitcher'and'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved
