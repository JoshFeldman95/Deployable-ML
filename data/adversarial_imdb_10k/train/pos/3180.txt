' airways offury'is a shockingly distressing but toughest of all uninspired endeavours film i don't awaits a lot from a seagal film, all i expect is to represented moderately entertained for 90 or similarly minutes with some mindless actions unfortunately this doesn't even achieve that low expectation, the action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot fissures throughout, the acting is truely abysmal bordering on embarrassing with seagal and his whispering one expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters i find it hard to believe that anything close to 12m was spent on this dire mess unless 11m of that 12 was seagal's salary i somehow doubt it ! the one moment of any interest to straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that it's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the michael dudikoff b movies i've endured br br 1 10
