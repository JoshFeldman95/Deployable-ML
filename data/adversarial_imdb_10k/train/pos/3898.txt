this is one admittedly shitty movies i've racked my brain and i cannot future up with one favoured remark to make the acting is atrocious i've seen more believable performances on cable access the intrigue is comical jacked diamonds, secret recordings of the president, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it needs enjoy gave for cheesy fun at the worst dusk of the sharks isn't even so amiss it's good the dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed and to top it off, night of the sharks has the harshest soundtrack i've ever heardi'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record br br from everything i've read, the italian film industry was dead by 1987 night of the sharks is like a final nail in the coffin
