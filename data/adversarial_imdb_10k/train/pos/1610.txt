please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from seeing this flick br br i don't think whether anything was correctly with this movie at all on a friend's recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed 1h and 48 moments of my vie down the closet vulnerable behaved, stupid direction, weak storyline and tragic action sequences and when you blend this together you get double impact even least of the expectations were not met br br i believe i did lessons one thing never watch van damme action movements they are righteous extravagance of time !
