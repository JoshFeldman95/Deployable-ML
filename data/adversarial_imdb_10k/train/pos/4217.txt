the reviews i read for this movie were pretty exemplary upon i decided to check it out bad notion ! this is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends the story is dumb, mix three parts ringu with one part homecoming night, a sprinkle of i know what you do last summer, and add a tiny dash of single white females now blends until wholeheartedly nonsensical there is nothing new to this plots, and revisiting the cliches i've soared accordingly merit of wasn't even joke this time this movie jumps to and from the past too considerable, and once i made sense of it all i realized it still didn't make much sense characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye speaking of characters, they are all your stereotypical favorites the greedy selfish lawyer, the egocentric actress, the has been baseball star, the video voyeur, the bitter girl, the spooky quiet chick,the'nicer thannice'nice girl, afreakin'black cat and i didn't care about any of them perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work, there were some decent scenes in it, but overall this movie was a mess i should also mention acertain'videotape'that would have been impossible to shoot br br this movie isn't the worst asian horror has to offer by far, but it is still pretty bad if you just want to see some creepy images in the dark, or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting, or just want to yell you're stupid ! at a movie screen, or just want to have another asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you've seen this movie is for you br br those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere
