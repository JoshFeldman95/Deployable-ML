i haven't saw the original, but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far wicker man is the shittiest productions i've sighted this year eventually even in two years i wish i could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it br br i'll let it three positive ida the sarcasm of cage's ascribe at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was magnificent appologize, that's it here impending the jeering the film's plotted is only propelled forward therefore other character won't confer cage any straight answers and he puts up with this ! ! ! how this could go on for over an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me br br not to mention that the plot is full of holes you leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library how anyone could read this script and think, yes, people should pay 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like is beyond me br br don't go see this flick or even rent it on dvd
