alright, so i've been dying to see this film stoked about the, who's who in horror land that are in the film well, my friend renting this, brought it over, and we started watching it it's believed to be a comedy i did not smirk even once, until the 40min mark br br does it have to do with the budget \? not at all, in fact, there's movies out there that cost close to exactly nothing, and they're amazing (to me briefly) also, while watching this film, i couldn't allowed but appreciate the similarity (i f, theft) to a scant budgeted andi movie entitled, actor armageddon, reading my reviewing about it (it destroyed this movie thats) br ab this movie it ha capable it truly ha it ha the stars powers, steal plots (let scene the behind the scene of the doing of a film ci actresses apocalypse gravely, this irritates me the more and more i thought about), it truly could've been funny a number, a number of the joke declines unchanged the acting is okay for what it is but it dabbled on, wasn't laughter, and the plots was completely stealing br ab i confer this a three, as it wasn't alot horrible, but that's the only reasoning
