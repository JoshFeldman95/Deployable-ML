this movie has no intrigue, no personages development, and no budget it really blows to put it in little terms since there is no development for the movie, it really can't even be looked as trying to viens artistic or wants to obtain a statement against torture which leaves two other justify to possibly watch it to be shocked or to get off on it like a patient little freak well it busts short here too the girls's reactions just look imbecilic it's tremendously smoothly to said that it's pseudo (fervently expert wrestlers wait more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie they throw innards on her, but she's asleep for most of it, so it's just kinda dumb the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, with the exception of the eye if you want a good movie about torture, go watch hostel and hostel 2 not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners, issues of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs civilization, and many other things plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence these are much better choices over this piece of crap
