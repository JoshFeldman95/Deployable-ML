one of my highest pals brought this movie over one night with thewords'wanna look the dumbest horrifying films ever \?'i consistently enjoy a good humorous at a bad horror flick and remarked yes i had expected your typical cheesy ii slasher but this was beyond b this is z slasher, the slower of the low with obviously low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so called'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like house of wax look amore oscar winning masterpieces the only bueno thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless she had some very nice tits most of what i said during this film was along the linesof'wow this is actually so bad','this is the worst movieever'and'i'm not drunk enough for this' so in conclusion don't waste your time (or money !)
