recognizable slams on microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economists generally brit ab wacky tolerant tim robbins plays a painfully clear caricature of bill gates, and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering assassinations properly and gauche brit brit while microsoft may incur in some anticompetitive operandi at moments, it's persuasive they actually homicidal persons therefore, the films is over the top and laughable from the beginning br br the deeper point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public, and not subject to intellectual property laws however, this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives (and rewards) provided by intellectual property br br it's one thing to be opposed to anti competitive conduct that's common sense it's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place, which is what the film's mantra (knowledge belongs to mankind) represents br br yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality
