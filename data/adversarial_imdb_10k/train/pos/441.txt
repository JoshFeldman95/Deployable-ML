i just can't imagine any possible causes why madsen and hopper wanted to be in this movie after reading the script they got blackmailed maybe \? or are they that improperly out of money \? the main problem with the flick is that it's tiring the conferences between andersen's and hopper's characters are superfluous, just amore the bored chatting between two buddies while liquor bottles on a sunday night you never feel for any of the character (although lundgren's hysterical assassinating is entirely likable, likened to the other character) hopper relentlessly was a good entertainer, and madsen did a admirable jobs as the serial murders, otherwise the acting is almost ridiculous there are about five scene in the whole film where something is indeed happens, every of them former about five mins although the conversation and thoughts about murdering and the character of killers scene would ha been unforgettable, if they were scene in a books the whole concepts would've been fascinating for a fiction, but a film just won't bary with a tale with that sizable dwelling thoughts and thus small actions
