i have to cite this is one of the lamest movies i've ever interpreted they had a wholly super storyline to expend on, but than the messing it up also spectacularly first of all the casting is all wrong, where know that van peeble (fuck actors btw) and puff dad get from \? \? \? it appear iike carlito have be from the hood, and used to hang about with some pragmatic idiots this flick gotn't making carlitos trail any righteousness lam also joyous that the sequel carlito's manner occurred out first, if i became viewed this rubbish first, i would have never given the pacino version a chance and anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought it's crap and did the sequel instead carlito's way rise to power 1 out of 10 carlito's way 9 out of 10
