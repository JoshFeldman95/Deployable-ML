this film was accompli for people who found gremlins too serious and critter to hardcore like many of the critter fiends gremlins productions of the 80's this moviemaking is bad the unfortunate segment is that there's no punchline to that comment it's just shitty and not in a laughing way br br the issue with this miniature monster movie is that it actually aims to coming funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as howie mandell was in walk like a man what made the other 80's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary, but were hilarious as they failed so miserably someone must have told bettina hirsch (yes the bettina hirsch) she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie unfortunately they were wrong br br sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the lost boys is amusing, but not enough to save the movie br br by far the most annoying part of the movie is the paul character his paul reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy not that i did that br br so the bottom line is run, don't walk, to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves
