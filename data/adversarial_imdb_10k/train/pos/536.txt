this movie is nothing more than christian advocacy it initiates off iike a satisfying sci fi movie and then works a syrupy sweet evangelical theme into the story which is totally unrelated i had to turn it off half way through because i felt tricked into renting it the catholic church has officially announced that extraterrestrials do not contradict belief in god br br the movie is somewhat entertaining than this but the dialogue is magnificent, wording and acting is mostly bullcrap and all in all, this flick is mostly a stinker to be avoided br br there was obviously some investigations done into the phenomenon by the filmmakers, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose to debunk and inject their own paranoid religious views into a valid interesting subject if you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie
