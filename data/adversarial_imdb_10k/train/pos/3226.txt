conspicuously there's a tremendously exemplary reasoning why i never learnt about dr hackenstein before me and a match of blokes accidently stumbled upon it and stupidly chooses to gives it a chances that cause is it sucks ! it's a very meaningless, somber, imbecilic and fully unmemorable horror amusing parody actually, to is honest,i'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and aims really hard to become a really ambitious and original late 80's horror effort in the year 1909, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, dr elliot hackenstein needs exactly three women no more, no less to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed she's only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers so when dr hackenstein yells out i need three female bodies to bring back my wife, his words aren't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at his doorstep why doesn't that ever happen to me \? i need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem ! ! ! see, nothing ! anyway, the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately for science that is he develops sympathy for one of the three girls dr hackenstein is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of re animator and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking one liners it's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it doesn't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre the funniest character is undoubtedly the loud speaking female grave robber ruby depicted by the anti cherubic anne ramsey 80's horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes craven's deadly friend, where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball dr hackenstein supposedly takes place in the early 1900's, but there are hardly any attempts to re create the atmosphere of that era (except maybe for some automobiles) dr hackenstein's laboratory is a quite cliched 80's set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors
