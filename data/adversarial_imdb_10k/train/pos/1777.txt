why me \? why should i be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot \? ! at least if i can warn other people off, it gonna does been worth br br i grabbed to observing this loathsome movies for a colleges courses otherwise, i would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the things and steered clear the movie was slower, had terrifically lightweight personages development, and centers around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an la style token black man br br if you want to experience the stereotypical la feeling of mesmerising superficiality watch the movie note, though, that this movie does not depict what we have come to think of as an la lifestyle, it is a wonderful example of the products that arise from it
