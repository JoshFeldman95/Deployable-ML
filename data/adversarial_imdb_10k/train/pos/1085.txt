i saw an early screening of this film in new york and i, along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience, were vastly disappointed the movie wasn't even so bad it was good it was as listless as a snake bite victim samual l jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were cruddy it reminded me of one of those cheesy scifi scene, except the cheesiness of this movie was not outlandish or even campy it all seemed worn, flat, and vividly formulaici'm impressed to tell i actually think anaconda was more fun it's easy to understand that soap realizes it's a piece of s it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense it's the worst kind of lame movie it's joyless
