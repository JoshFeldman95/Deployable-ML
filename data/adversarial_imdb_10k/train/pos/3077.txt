enjoyed a trailers for this on another video, and picked to rent when it came out boy, was i upset ! the storytelling is impressively tiring, the behaving (additionally from christopher walken) is bad, and i couldn't care less about the characters, aside from really wanting to see nora's husband get thrashed christopher walken's role is such a spear elsewhere, what a tease !
