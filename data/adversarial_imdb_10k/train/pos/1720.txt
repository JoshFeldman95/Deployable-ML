i loved to like this film, yes its a saw, bla bleh blah ripoff but i like those films if fulfilled equally this grabbed all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film spectacularly those additives had gone off ! the acting was abysmal, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just abysmal, yes i know, bad writting but this is more than that, it was bad writing coupled with bad acting three of the captives lasted been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film br br sorry, im even wondering why i am bothering to review this movie at all br br i will end with plot holes, plot holes more plot holes ! disappointing !
