and i has viewed some bad ones br ab i enjoy nothing better to noted about this films the behaving is imperfect by jenny tilly as to got expectations daryl jenny does an fine job, but nothing narrowly to being incapable to spare this movie br br the biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so unstable though based on a good premise that the writer resorted to the stupid heroine trick to create a contrived suspense when all daryl hannah would have to do is hide, she runs out in front of her pursuer the hospital scene is absurd without exposing too much of what passes for a plot, i think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed lame very lame br br save yourself some time and pick out another flick
