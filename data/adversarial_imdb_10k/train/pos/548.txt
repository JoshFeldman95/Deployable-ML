i can't believe that someone honestly payrolls to have this movie made stupid, unrealistic, and stereotypical right from the take off of the massive 747 the experience pulled the throttles back to increase speed then you have 5 armed persons with semi to fully automatic weapons firing without so considerable as one bullet breaching the walls of the pressurized cabin at 38, 000 feet then once below in the belly of the plane a stray bullet hits a refilling harmony and we view the stoking elude from the aside of the flight the acting was just heinous and binding there just didn't seem to be any direction i have seen some pretty horrid b movies in my lifetime but with the names that were in this film i was extremely disappointed
