this is not a exemplary movie it's differing, all the acting is bad, and has a uninspired stories you've seen a thousand times done much better else where not to say you can see every plot point coming from a mile away worst of all, no one annoyed to tells lonette mckee she ain't crooning but who cares, she's sooooo damn exemplary looking but i digress, nothing new here bottom line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, everyone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens surprise, surprise welcome to the music business i can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie so many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading black movies i don't play that ! if you want to support these films by going to see them great ! if you enjoyed it super ! to each his own but don't try to tell me it was good pleeeease ! i wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors wanna see a good african american movie \? see love jones ray or the color purple those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin why \? because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film it's only good when it's good period
