ya i rented it, so shoot me ! br br a decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff, but at least it's shot well director jon keeyes opting the simple idea of a fake haunting housing with real hazard inside in most instances this wanted be a slam dunk, but this little stinker derails quite quickly the cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best, but the storytelling and writing is just lowlands nasty least scene trawling on timeless and the scares are too rare and tremendously in between with no veritable peak to the movie an eerie atmospheric is sets at the start but looses it's grandeur before any types of horror appears, and i discovered myself bore to deaths and doing another sandwiches the cover artwork is trying and i presume it's worthwhile a rented if you're searching for ludicrous scant budgeted dreck, but if you enjoying a alright narrative and unforgettable ended, reaching for something else
