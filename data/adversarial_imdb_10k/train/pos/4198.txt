this flick was admittedly the worst movies i was ever construed here are the stuff that timely hopping out at me 1 the forest were more analogous foothills in las seattle with a pair tree and rub not scary whatsoever media flashes, if you are filmed in the easterly ca district, hefty bear is only an moment remotely they undoubtedly has tree there ab brit 2 the writing was powerfully without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever been every possible line in the movie was retread, clich√©, or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood (cruddy), the name of the clown is the killer clown (lame) what is a clown doing in a forest anyway \? was that the only mask they could find \? 3 the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph it's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy, but she was not also, and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me, was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run, that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played kat, good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself br br if for some reason you do see this movie, i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids
