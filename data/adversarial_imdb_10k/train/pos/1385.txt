i saw this backin'94 when it was finally released apparently because orion pictures was in bankruptcy, i think, the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier br br i have problem remembering details partly because i haven't seen it in a long time, but i do remember it as a very humdrum movie i kept debating whether to walk out of it the store was not at all interesting or participant was a 3rd rate america graffiti imitation br br none of the performances deliver it valuable watching either one of the longest disappoints until a local newspaper reviewer yielded it a high rating
