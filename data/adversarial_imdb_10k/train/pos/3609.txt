this film, originally released at christmas, 1940, was long thought lost a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd, now for sale don't buy it ! the cinema is tremendously terrible the casting is poor, the script is awful, and the directing is frightful br br picture roland boyish harmonies and dancing and that was the highlight br br perhaps this movie was lost deliberately
