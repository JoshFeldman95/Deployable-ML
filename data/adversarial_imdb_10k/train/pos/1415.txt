at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn't worthy of primetime but after a few minutes of silly touched awe, i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we mastered it in surprises that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a slightly funniest spy versions of the overwhelming touched (i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd) with even biggest acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry elena, and not jim, after all of the hugging and high fives a few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier
