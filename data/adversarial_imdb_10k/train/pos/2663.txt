i dunno what the hype around this is this is really a poorly movie it gotten nothing to me, the only descent scenes is where everyone permeates collectively at the parties, and a enjoyable soulful is spawning, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move that was the best segments of the movie otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in there's no tale, there's nothing to thought about like some people say, there's no sameness between the different stories it was more of an attempt to re do anderson's'magnolia'which was brilliant, but it lacks blatantly okay it's light and easy to watch, but that are movieclips too maybe first write a story before you make a movie 4 10 one of the worst belgian movies i've seen
