certain i've seen shitty films in my viva, but this one was tad bad that i actually became angry in the theater i wanted my money back i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket, of course i getsn't receive a refund (or even a reply) but it's the regard that matters on a scale of 1 10 i give this movie a 42 why gets the wrangler (isuzu cardigan \? \?) stops runs from being hits with a bats \? why gets they hitting the jeep (isuzu polo \? \? \? \? \?) with the bat in the first places otherwise of cracks the stinker's skeleton \? the plots was compact, the film fills with evident cliche, and individual fractions of it just didn't exert any logic
