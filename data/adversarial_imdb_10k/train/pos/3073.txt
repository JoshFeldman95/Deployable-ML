any movie that has nude scenes of karen allen andi'm conversely once boring i walk out, that is a jerk ! br br karen gets stuck in paris, and befriends a sissily handsome french man with whom she is having sex soon of course he's married, (but, cheri, why should that coming a problems \?) what could become an odd clash of culture is (think it or not) just dull i proceeded out br br ultimately the movie got a lot better after i left but it would have had to have gotten a lot better to make up for a rotten beginning br br my advice, if you find yourself in this, run, don't walk, for the exit save your time and your energy most assuredly save your money it's a shame the production company didn't save its money
