i think likelihood a film which boasted a cast including petero'toole, susannah york, michael craig harry andrews chances happen worth watching alack, i was wrong utter pretentious absurd from beginning to end with botho'toole and york overacting wildly i watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about i've a feelingo'toole plays the laird of a scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reminiscence childhood games with his sister (york) he is also barking mad but apart from that, your guessing is as good as mine br br the film possesses no redeeming feature whatsoever i can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary, unimaginative, stagy piffle clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director risible
