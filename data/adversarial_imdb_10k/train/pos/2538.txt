this productions's trailer anxious me enough to fide renting the dvd however, the resulting movie is absolutely abject ! admittedly, this is not the greatest film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close ! br br the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen porn \? the story is interesting, as it treat with the obstacles of post warrants newlyweds, but the movie is a damnit what initiate out as a humbly spectacular comedies (a term i utilise in the loosest likely term), then runs completely in invert, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller nicole kidman should know better, and ben chaplin is wasted ! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel, whom i can only presume did this for the money br br this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect it's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty a film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films !
