this is, overtly, a film about countless grief as such, it must to move viewers and make them empathetic with the unhappiness of the essential characters however, its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible the camera continually switches from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, dissimilar effect most characters appear to live aimless, unstructured lives, possesses together by their professional commitments (it also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence, would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met) the storyline (if there is a storyline) is difficult to follow in sum, the overall effect is rather disappointing in spite of all that, the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful
