this could ont been a earnestly exemplary movie if someone would just have known how to completion the film br br the story was going along just fine and heading towards that point in every movie like this where the gray characters turn good and the bad guys get their just desserts and boom it's like they ran out of script and the cast just started to make things up br br which wouldn't have been so bad if the cast became just continued with the character development they had already put in place but such is not the case and the movies soon becomes a goofy damnit ab br my advises is to watch this movie up to about the final 30 mins and then shutting it off at this regard, envision how you believe the next 30 mins going expect basis on what you ha saw thus extraordinarily ab br believes me, the ending you coming up with gonna seem much preferable than how this movie indeed ending trust me on this
