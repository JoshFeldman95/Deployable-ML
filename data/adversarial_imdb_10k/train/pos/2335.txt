the'60s is an generally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film it is extremely erratic, and includes many annoying elements take for instance the switch between black white, and color if done right, this could of been fairly effective, but because it was done poorly, it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already negative experience much of the film had an odd feel to it the acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for tv flick, but then again it was quite embarrassing at other times many of the events were not consistent, and ending up being confusing how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's \? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes because it was hollywoodized, everything had to turn out right in the end i would advise you to not waste your time onthe'60s and do something else with your timei'm glad i watched this in class, and not on my own time i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan's music those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick i hope you take my advice, and stay away from this
