ok, lets get one thing straight, i love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones so with this in mind lets proceed raptor is a truly horrific film, in fact its not even a film in its specific right as it is cobbled together from smithereens of carnosaur, carnosaur 2 primal species carnosaur 3 there is some new footage with eric mcbride as a sheriff and his busty protégé fulfilment around looking troubled, frightening or whatever it is there trying to expresses (spectacularly) on the psychological scale but then how can they react to something that was filmed several ages earlier the producers (yes roger corman i'm talking about you !) even went to the lengths of hiring 2 people from carnosaur to play bit parts so there grisly death scenes can be reused ! so this film is the cheapest of the cheap watch the 3 original movies, there no oscar winners but they have some meritt and entertainment value but avoid raptor oh, it also has the most pointless sex scene that runs for nearly 10 minutes ! do you think they were trying to pad out the running time \?
