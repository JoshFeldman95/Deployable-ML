it's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show the bad acting, unsatisfactory acoustics of different portions, bad cgi, improper sets for the period, the amiss scripts it would have been nice if the script followed the original tale a soon closer there's enough tension and good material in beowulf to provide a great treat of good material, and a better story line, than the scriptwriters could come up with br br and why presents a strange new weapon like a crossbow that fires explosive bolts \? br br i see that this movie was made in only 21 days it shows in the lack of qualityi'm beginning to think this is general (poor) attitude taken by sci fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of classic tales in the past few years br br what a waste !
