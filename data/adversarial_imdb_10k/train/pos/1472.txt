the immortalizer was, eah, fascinating it certainly didn't killing me during its hour and a half duration, but it didn't impress me much either a group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinema's least unconvincing head crushes audio effect) and captures to a fancy house in the suburbs here doctorate divine and his team are performing brain imprints for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as freejack ! who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice \? with all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of from beyond and re animator dancing in theproducers'heads but the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off i've never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore the acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from clarke lindsley as the assistant dr price he has a nice evil laugh the only other thing of note about the immortalizer is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks
