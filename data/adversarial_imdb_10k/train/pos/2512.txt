in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a frightful experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer the plot is thin to say the least, the cantonese dialog is not comedy see this movie at your peril br br david tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no pays this film will generate the frivolous plot attempts to compete with other rom coms out there, and just unites into the scenery it was like watching paint dry br br in short this movie was a total waste of time and space i've seen better movies on youtube
