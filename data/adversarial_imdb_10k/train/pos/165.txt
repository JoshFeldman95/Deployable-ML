i gave this movie a rating of 1 because it is by tremendously, the worse movies i've ever levied in my life this movie was incurred in 2003 and i've seen movies arose in the 60's with better special effects i seeking i could go into detail, but words can't describe how cruddy this film was i could enjoy realised better with a home video cameras and 20 ! i requisitions that chuck norris never makes a film again now if you think i'm plunged this movie so it enjoys a evangelical theme, you're incorrect i like the actuality that il' chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good, but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie \? this whole film can be summed up in 3 words re damn diculous
