i am a huge vents of the comic book series, but this moviemaking drenched way below my expectations i projected a tremendous metal 2000 kinda feel to it slow moves, amiss dialogues, plentyo'blood but this was worse than anything i could gets imagined br br the plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there the characters don't recieve the dynamic or spirit that phoning my attention in the comic series the movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and tiring than later parts the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more fascinating comprehensive intrigue of the comic literature brit brit with the true humans work on this projects, it could ha been amazing regrettably, it wasn't that ways, thus now there is yet another dreadful film that small volition behold and even less volition adores my copies volition certainly collects mote for yr until i ultimately jettison it out
