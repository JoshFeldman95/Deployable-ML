this film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control it's exquisite bored in beautiful pictures for once hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots however, what i found hard to toma about the moviemaking was that although franziska schute was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are this whole lolita somethings especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy the heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is come on, coitus is a nice past time between consenting adults another thing i found odd was that neither beart nor schute have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at least
