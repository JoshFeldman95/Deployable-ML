can only get described as terrible it is bad to start with and then gained even more shitty when you begins you truly recieve to watched it through because it is unable to recognizing that it can come worse but affraid not because it does another wrongfully writes script for a donkey administration for no ability descendant of past movie stars it's hard to decide if the script is worse than the acting or whether the directing is shittiest than both as for the hero well he belts up everyone including one scene where he beats the living daylights out of the tough by swinging open the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it and in another scene he gets thrown through a window and crashes 20ft onto concrete doesn't even blink then gets up immediately and gets stuck into the baddies this is a really ridiculous movie lucky it only cost me 1 to hire
