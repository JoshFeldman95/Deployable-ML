i enjoy to say this is an horrendous movies, for the barely circumstance that when you see this film on the guide, it is reflected as a documentary as i watched it, i started laughing, perceptions to myself, could this guys actually anticipation me to thought this is real \? once i haya to look it up, and now see that it is a movie, but now since it isn't a documentary, it is now a movie with wrong acting so, either routing, it is pretty lousy i actually didn't make it to the end i had to latch it off i am a nyc police officer, and felt that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking this is a documentary, with the intentions of making money off of a terrible day for me and my coworkers so, i took it a little personal maybe i was blinded by that, and it isn't as bad as i personally think it is everyone has their own opinion
