another british cinema flag waver real dustbin on offer here once again i cannot understand (and i am british) why this over the greatest, patriotic madness was ever made eight years mark you, from when the second world war had actually ended ! other commenter's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage this is extremely poorly observed the archive footage is in abundance model aircraft swing from wires inthe'actionscenes'like so many children's kites in the wind the classic map room sequences tattoos the movie to make us conceivably pulls into the whole lire event heineken must ha his worst acting performance ever the shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area ealing made many great movies this clearly is not one of them they should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot !
