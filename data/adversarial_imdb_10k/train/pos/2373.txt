ok, just by reads the titles you would imagined that it would es a good film well, at least i did it began out good but became so uninspiring after the first half h spoiler br br it tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleading that she will go to any lengths to get what she expect the only problem is that her niece's friend is the woman in the way she always defeating the competitors, therefore pushing the mother further towards eliminating her after talking to a hitman, the mother picks that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit so action are been but she eventually gets caught br br the cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening don't waste your time watching this br br
