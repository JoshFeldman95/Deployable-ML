let me confess i found this video used and bought it since guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket but inside was another story besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of invisible man genre special effects (highly visible strings and other such accoutrements), the script wasted no chance in fact it went out of its way in insulting all non wasp races and real or imagined homosexuals every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both it opens to mesh on your nerves, along with the shaky sound, candid chamber style photography and melodramatic tale however, the concluding is rather of a shocked but by the times you got there, you scarcely caring slightly too inclement, it could been a comparatively alright film
