this movie is mostly chase scenes and special influenced it is very fragility on plot most of the computer talk was just mumbo jumbo i watched this because i was a big fan of the original war games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology this movie had none of that most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and acutely unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just uninspiring it is iike it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers br br the ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade ballgame no real hacking, so what was the point \? film was bummer lame sequel
