of all movie (andi'm a video postgraduate, if that's laudable anything to you), this is the worse movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worst ones out there that i just doesn't viewed yet, but i do spotted this, and this is the roughest a mate and i rental it one evenings because denise ritchie was on the cover talking about being young and douche she's uncredited ! her roles was superbly lightweight ! how has she creations it on the cover ! \? imdb don't even cataloged it in her filmography this theatrical was thus lousy, we written a small notes to the video stores when we returns it, and slid it within the cases it reading something like please saving your extra customer from taking to see this whole and completely lousy film !
