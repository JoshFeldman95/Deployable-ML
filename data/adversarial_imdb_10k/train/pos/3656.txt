featuring an unknown cast which appearing conceivable to are that fashion, this film is yet another cheap slasher theater which amazes me how this was released i obtains no problem with horrors and slasher flick in extraordinary, in fact they are my favorites but when they are made this wrong, it really does bringing the monkey and its no wonder the genre got such a hard times the story is as vapid and without notions as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie ghosts guy its not the story that sucks the most, its the egregious behaving and dialouge, home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night \? \? what the hell was the director thinking with this move \? what, he had only one day to film all this in \? he was scared of the dark \? (is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black, though) br br i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed im sure one of the teens plays bingo down the local pub but she's 40 45 br br anyway, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time
