i know nothing of the iliad so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story however, as a stand alone film i found this very tiring the battle scenes endeavour to is great and spectacular but they were just obvious cgi br br the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies but he does not creations a good warrior, too pretty i am afraid br br good points are is the design this film does eye good with the landscape and castle constructed hurdle impressive i do like a film that at least tries to recieve the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely we hear american, scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation br br all in all, i don't recommend this film for a family sit down it is too long and the young will get bored br br for adults, it is ok if you don't care about the lack realism
