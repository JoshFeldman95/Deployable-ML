though not a fan of sam rockwell, i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the openingof'joshua'heck, i wasn't even aware he wasin'joshua'until i started the movie so it goes without saying, i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads a sortof'rosemary's baby,'' theomen'or any other demonic kidmovie'joshua'was billed unfortunately, it fell flat doldrums, fantastically slow, and flat yet, i continued on to view how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject okay, i admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing and what a low low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it a person falls you don't see the drop, you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood a person gets hit by a cab you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike upi'm not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects we have a rich family with a crazy mom, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid joshua, who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot she cries as much as we see how many days she's alive and what was that about \? are there rats above or is it joshua \? is his mother nuts \? is joshua crazy \? is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family \? is he going to grow up to be michael myers \? or does he drive his family to the brink \? i don't think so they were nuts prior, and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shuti'm sure that might have been the idea, but for pete's sake, give me something anything there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore joshua's more like the mini me of the antichrist
