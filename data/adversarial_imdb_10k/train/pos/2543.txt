i had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo intellectual product for pretentious film viewers) twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and bleak enough to inspire yawns, not to mention that i was tad near cries over the 3 99 i had wasted at blockbuster joanna pacula's acting and her terrifically rendered slavic accent are successfully tragic to set one to gritting one's tooth i thought that two hours of her would be two hours too numerous both breuer and nietzsche are conducted by unremarkable actors of magnificently paltry seasoned while we're on the topic of talent, breuer's supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe she clearly has not learned her craft in fact, she's really quite awful all the public scenes looked staged, with the extras walking mechanically about in their sunday best turning this film off was far more satisfying than turning it on don't rent this terrible movie you will be sorry you spent your money
