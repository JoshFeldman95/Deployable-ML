this film is riveting but in much the same way a vehicle crash is enthralling it's hard to look away overall, this films is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and a petty, biased flyboy at that the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to has no problems abandoning for the minimal possible denominator the method in which the financially is filed to ted is pure exploited the intervening deeds that the film force ted to participate in (meeting with so called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive pursuit to plugged with ted instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit ted's situation the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after 6 months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before if they had cared, they would have found better experts to help ted if they truly wanted to see what ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention this film is at best a high brow jackass stunt and not a documentary it's sad to think how much 100, 000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands
