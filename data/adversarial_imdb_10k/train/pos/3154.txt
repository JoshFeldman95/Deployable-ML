pretty inauspicious movie offers nothing new the usual creaks and moans attempt to make up for a muddled, but thin story acting is barely above pathetic why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone's guess owen wilson truly turns in one of the roughest performances in recent horror movie history catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above average job the special effects were very memorable and the domicile itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous however they can't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute don't bother
