oooooh, the infamous guinea pig series i honestly have to say that i've been disappoints as a whole by this entire series (he never dies, mermaid in a manhole, and flower of flesh and blood being the exceptions and even those aren't great by any means), but devil's experiment just straightforward strokes there is nothing realistic looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps confrontational climactic, conforming on how you perspectives it) ojo pierced scenes the victims showings to not really caring what is going on and barely whines or groans while being subjected to hideous (more often sometimes hilarious) tortures flower of flesh and blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film making, but devil's experiment just doesn't hold up worth a look if you are a die hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3 10 and that's only for the needle through the eye scene
