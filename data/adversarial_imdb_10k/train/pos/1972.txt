this film is roughly what it sounds like a futuristic version of the cinderella legend but with songs and (fairly tame) sex scenes ! the film is not sure what it wants to be and somewhat much ends up a mess it's more expensive looking than most of director al adamson's films but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci fi films the actors are pretty pernicious and unlike most adamson films, there are no former big namers or b actors some of the music is ok but it's tenderly to see why cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years
