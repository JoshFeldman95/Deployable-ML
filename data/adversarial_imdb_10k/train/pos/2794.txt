i cannot believe the same guy direct this codswallop and casanova 2000 bram 2000 was revolutionary, fresh, and quite written, if thinly act ab ab this piled can't even claim that it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that following the narrative properly could be incurred this a good sequel somehow, but craven chose to go in the style of his older films, having no good tie but the main villain's name ab br even the actor play helsing was different (going from dark hair in helsing 2000 to a blonde here) br br avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies
