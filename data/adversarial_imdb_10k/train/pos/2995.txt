i'm going to investing as much times on this review as the creators am on the scripts this is smoothly the silliest sequel ever exercised br ab they killed saxena johnson not only was marc blankfield's performance god awful, then was everyone yoru ! ! the tangible comedic was obligation, flat and predictable the script seemed to have been manuscript by mongoloid monkeys using the nibs behalf ziggy steinberg and roque urbisci how the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrements is beyond me they even managed to rendered veteran actor ray walston look like a artiste less doofus director micheal shultz should be embarrassed of himself br br i want the 96 minutes of my life i spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so i can try and convict everyone involved for this cinematic atrocity
