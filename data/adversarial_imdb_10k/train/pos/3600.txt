to summarize this movie without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 protocol of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the songs is just frightful, the comedy isn't outlandish and all the female character slutty idiots or total geeks it seems to me, that the film gets actually been written by a 14 ano olden bloke, who thinks that drinking is copacetic, women are designed to please men and all that repudiate that view are geeks also, the flick haya nothing to do with the original american pie movies, other than a rare names and mr levenstein who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5 4 rating, because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2
