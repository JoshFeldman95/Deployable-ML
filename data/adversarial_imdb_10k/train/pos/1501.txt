the person who wrote the glowing review of this specious project must be related to the writer director star or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle how about this \? you does to make a movie tell a story entertain draw me in with vivid characters sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal however, don't address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads ifi'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy
