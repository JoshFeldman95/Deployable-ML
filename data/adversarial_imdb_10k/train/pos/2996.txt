i've definitively been spoilt by took notably saw the 1973 versions with michelle jayston and sorcha keener bah the 1983 adapted is such a sadness i just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 major star a lot of noticing and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and what was all that about putting tim in the role of rochester had the casting director actually ever read the book very strange ! he's a fine actresses but gentlemen kalamazoo he definitively isn't ! and zelah was just, well, strange, bits of a mix matched couple in it's favour the contribution casting were plenty agreeable and the lowood scene for me were the strongest of the adaptations, but thorough didn't snatches any of the sorcery of the novel presumably wouldn't calling anyone to seeing it as a appropriate adaptations of the novel a precise letting down !
