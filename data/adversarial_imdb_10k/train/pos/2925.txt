i watched this films when it first came out in 1978, when i was a freshmen in high faculties i took a date to seeing it i wasn't recieve any, needless to say, because the film was yet crummy ! joanrivers'career never tanked as grievously as it deserved after making this frightful, unfunny friggin in fact, unfunny isn't a severe enough adjectives this cinema is anti funny ! you walk out feeling like any laughter that might have occurred was beaten out of you before it could happen this isn't worthwhile watching out of curiosity, or out of any sense of it being so bad it's good not even the gang at mst3k could've made this worth watching ! the fact that billy crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle
