this is just a rotten movie with what rang to is tremendously a nice budget it had potential to be much better it almost were with the heroines beautiful almost like salma hayek, hero fighting almost like jackie chan, battles and duels almost like in crouching tiger, music almost like in, say, conan etc almost but in the end it's just dull and it is harsh to find anything intriguing in it perhaps apart of jun rhys davies flights in fighting like those warriors in hero or before mentioned crouching tiger i am wholeheartedly demeaning of poor archaic john he is after all quite a exemplary actors and deserves much better so as you so if you still have a chance just watch something else
