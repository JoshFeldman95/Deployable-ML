i picked up this movie in the hope it would be synonymous to the hilarious the gamers by dead gentlemen producing (which is highly recommendable, by the way) boy, what a disappoint ! the movie is shot in this bogus documentary style made famous by the office but it overlooks to deliver the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing true, it can either funny to accustomed every singe cliches there is about role plaything game, but here it is achieved in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top there is no subtlety in this movie, if there would be captions laugh now or a cheap 80s style fake laughter track it would not make much difference with some scenes you can't help to think yea, i get why they thought this would be funny but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke
