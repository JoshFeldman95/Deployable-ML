spoilers throughout br br the gettaway is mostly an action movie and what strides there is to ! ! shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more it stars kim bassenger and alec baldwin as the mc coy's br br this is a remake and i have not seen the original but perfectly wasn't caring for this one at all although bassenger and baldwin enjoy some magnificent screening chemistry but the movie itself didn't do it for me br br the gettaway became really irksome really quickly the plot is overshadowed by one fight chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, bassenger and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in in fact, by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning i don't think bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture br br this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here the gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull it really could have been better i think br br bassenger and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale didn't enjoy this one to much
