as far as spaghetti westerns go, i'd put this man can't die on the bleak side of the genre it's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it rarity the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen guy madison does his best in the lead role, but flaw the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off with one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't radically advisable the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before there's just not much to get very excited about br br the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes (note the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong rosalba neri does not play jenny benson instead, she is the character melini'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie)
