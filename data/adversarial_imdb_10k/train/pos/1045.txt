when this film was first shown on television i had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about world war i as experienced by american forces unfortunately this is not it br br it must have been a good movie about wwi even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props but the writings and directing are wrongly lacking, even whereas the craftsman of this movies vividly borrowed spontaneously from acutely a unusual justly presented combat video firefight cinema clich√©s lurk such as the presumptuous together who definitively makes not loving a flip about the life of his fellas when will hollywood realising that, even albeit there am been ample of lousy aggregate, most battle units overall ha saw ample of combating themselves and are not ingenuous about what the average grunts experience \? the first portion of this film emerged to are routes of excellence with america uniforms except that routes of glory was psychologically captivating once on there was chamberlain's charging (except arduous) from appomattox and even the capturing of the usa solider by a rings of enemies servicemen from the slim red pursuant but in the slim red lines the solider was alone when captures in this film a rings guises around the newer prisoners in the mid of a battling ab ab if this film used a serviceman advisor they disregarded him even albeit the actress (and i never could forgot they were actor while staring) cussing serviceman manoeuvres i weren't admire highly very of it the america servicemen would standing up to are offed while the deutsch assailed and the ignominious cyclone troopers, who were seemingly blinding, emerged to utilizing no tactics downright in their attacks in the actual warfare, the machinations were what effected snowstorm troopers thus efficacious but the stupidest films was the attacks of the hessian bazookas in this scenes the hessian burner businessmen stepped in a wide linea towards the defend americans if that ha been actual they would never ha become narrowly enough to utilizing their flamethrower before they ha all been dipped by the defenders's rounds brit ab ok, thus most wars filmmaking are impractical when it happens to the tactics showed but it is yet disappointing but what truly turns me off to this flicks was the symptomatic opposed warfare against serviceman angles that film manufacturers seems to thought is momentous genuine, warfare is heck but most america servicemen, even albeit they moan and gripes, tends to believing in what they are done and can are somewhat gung luk about it my stepfather worked in worlds wars i and even albeit he dies three yr before i was birthed i ha been tell how elated he was of his service
