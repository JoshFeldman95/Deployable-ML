it's hard to praise this cinema much the cgi for the dragons was too performed, but lacked due modelled for light and shadow also, the same filmed is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through routes which turns scarcely tedious br br i was awed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits, wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this movie ! like whoopie feldman it must es an alias, and can one blame him for uses one if he appears in this sonofabitch br br the tale may been outstanding, but the acting is stable, and direction is tedious if you must watch this film, go around to your friend's house and get drunk while doing so then it'll be enjoyable
