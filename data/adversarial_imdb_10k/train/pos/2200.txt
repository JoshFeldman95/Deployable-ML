' i faitn't realizing none of this becoming any idea !', exclaims one exasperated character towards the conclusion of death chuckles at murderers assuming just sat through this thoroughly puzzling hell of a movies, i know exactly how he feels the story, by the film's director aristide massacessi (good old joed'amato using his real name for a change), is a sensitive mix of the supernatural, murder mystery, and pretentious arty rubbish, the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts, but which had me struggling to remain conscious br br opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had been having an incestuous affair, before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor), death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman (played by ewa aulin, who stars in the equally strange'death laid anegg') is seen alive and kicking, the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbruck after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home, where she is tended to by creepy dr sturges (klaus kinski in a throwaway role), the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr and mrs ravensbruck (meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbianlovin') br br'so far, so good', i thought to myself at this point,'we've had hunchbacks, incest, some blood and guts, and gratuitous femalenudity'all ingredients of a great trashy euro horror what follows, however, is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings, ghostly goings on, and even elements from edgar allan poe's'the black cat', to tell a very silly, utterly bewildering, and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave br br this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb, but given the choice, i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career i guess incomprehensible, meandering, surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing ! 2 5 out of 10 (purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for imdb
