when i first watched robotboy, i discovering it fresh and interesting, but then i noticed, that with each episode this show is seeks to teach you how to behave yourself, what is bueno bad episodes became expected and main characters are not interesting again we see a hyper smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who don't understand their kid, and his friends girl and fat boy also this show has no logic a super modern robot who works on two aa size batteries, and can use a lot of weapons but the biggest concerns is the difference between activated and super activated modes we see two different robots, and it declines main idea of the show robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
