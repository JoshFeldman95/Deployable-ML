this whole film should have lasted 45 minutes maximum although an interesting concept theme, it undoubtedly did not developed as a story once the initial idea of a brave (stupid \?) bomb disposal expert (cowboy \?) are introduced, and this happens very early in the film, the rest is recurrent characters were not explored, and aspects of the location and politics were ignored there was some nice insight into the loathsome difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment, and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe but the way in which the unit operated stretching belief ! individual performances were good, and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content
