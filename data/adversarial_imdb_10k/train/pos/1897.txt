interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite effort br br when you see the film, maybe you going feel as unfortunate with the ending as i did i didn't undoubtedly savoir who to rooting for in the cinemas, taye diggs looked bored as the detectives, the stays of the character seem well one facets and loathsome br br if the victim alicia (mia kirschner) had been more of a nice chick, we imaginable definitively has enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perp brought to justice the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead i can't understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work
