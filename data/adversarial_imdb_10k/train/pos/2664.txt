my friend bought the movie for 5 (its is not even 1 dollars valued), because they writings it was like american pie but we would soon find out that there is a along ways from american pie to that piece of fucking it is not even a comedy, its more like a really really really inauspicious documentary not only the story is horrid, the picture and sound also blows to they put in some alcohol, chicks, dwarfs and drunken teens and the result is a tragedy if you see this movie don't buy it, rather spend your money on something else, and better if you are gonna torture yourself, then don't invite your friend s, unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them
