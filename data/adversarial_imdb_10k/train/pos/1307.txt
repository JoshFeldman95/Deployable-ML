oh it actually definitely is i've enjoyed movies that i hating more, due to whatever justify, but never am i seen a movies that just faulted in each unique matters of film adopt it even fails to fail at film making, in a manner the hercules in new york could be said to do it's not the film i like the least, but it is the very shittiest film i've ever seen br br the acting is the first thing that strike you i've never seen a worse practiced film outside of pornography in fact i've plenty of pornographic film that are acted a damn site better than this it really is awful br br technically, it's terrible the camera work is amateurish the editing is nonsensical i presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there's a lot of them) has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods (and there's a lot of them too) is actually dubbed from a studio, again lending more to the bad porn vibe br br the plot is nonsensical, as many have pointed out i'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythos br br speaking of vampire mythos, the writer had evidently read carmilla, or at very least seen the vampire loversi'm not sure how i feel about this, swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic noveli'm very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material at veryleast'thegeneral'is an insult to peter cushing though br br it gets two stars however, merely because i can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has, or at least purports to have, both vampires and zombies in it incidentally i watched lifeforce (another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it) on the same day as this, and despite being a rather flawed film itself, really comes out a masterpiece compared to this br br so in the end, this is not a film so bad it's good, or so bad it's in any way enjoyable, even drunk it's just a mess, and worth no one's time watching
