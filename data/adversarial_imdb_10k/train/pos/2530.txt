the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however, once the action shared to the home of ingrid's fiance, it all completely drenched apart instead of romance and charm, we see some terrifically dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiance's boorish son and the military attache's vying for the maid's attention looked stupid sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game, as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate (just as in the other film) i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game, but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film
