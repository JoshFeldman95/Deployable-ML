no instance how well vein his message is this film is a terrifically made trainwreck detestable interim, lame camera work i don't know why carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter he is lousy at it you watch the extras on the dvd and the way he has a camera follow him around he just soaks it up he loves being the center of attention he is a bad actor he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker eric schaffer some how carr has had this film shown at city youth centers and new age churches where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did but as a film itself it is choppy, predictable and sappy
