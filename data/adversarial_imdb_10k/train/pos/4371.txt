before starting to watch the show, i've hear it was great and aesthetically uncommonly interesting what a ploy, the scripts are so doofus that i am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of scoobidoo writers and what about the sfx and colors, they are so extreme that it is tough to watch, colors are not saturated they are over congested, like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated this show is adore a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient appallingly for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility
