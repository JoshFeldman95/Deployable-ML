this movie was so egregious it was almost good almost we love musicals, but not this one even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end) the character marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too br br the plot is very unexpected and could fi been humor without tragic anthems and cheezy piano music admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a bestest way) br br open abode is a comedic film to seeing scarcely once it is horrible ! we notion it opportunity are a lovely step musical (with striking actor)
