the first movie, man from snowy river, is one of the best i've seen, nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses rich girl poor boy, and ability versus bloodline the sequel, however, is not only a glaring aspired to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a nonsensical, overblown disneyfied damnit nicest briefly as rambo meets the black stud without the charm of the black stallion the young hero gets back from a 3 year absence, and suddenly he's superman on horseback in the upfront, good film, he was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel i've hardly been as disappointed in a movie, and at times this thing made me quite angry they missed hardly a cliche brazen audience manipulation do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them, to make them happy \? a mess of a movie
