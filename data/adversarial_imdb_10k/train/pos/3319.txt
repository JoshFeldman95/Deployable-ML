this sequel is a total rehash of the first film a vitally frivolous movie it basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in omen iv except with a female antichrist this time it even ends the same way as the first one ! the music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of omen i, it's extremely predictable it's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly tabled, there is much worse movies out there, this just had assuredly no matter in being took the omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so i guess it has that if you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, i guess i'd choose this
