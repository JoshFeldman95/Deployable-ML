it gets a great name, but thats it and you wont get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30 40mins of the movie you chances identifies it some categorize of laughs but after that the stories subsides from one lateral to another with no idiosyncratic cause and you just dunno understand whats occured until the action its going ab ab and yet the production (roberto angel salcedo) calls him an actor, but i amn't think the way he does could be termed nothing but overacting ! ! moments the restrained jr who play as his son has strictly no sensing of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing br br for some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it, but they didn't ! ! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad, i don't buy it br br but hopefully this is as bad as it gets to make people accept those dvd's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it, that might work out br br maka
