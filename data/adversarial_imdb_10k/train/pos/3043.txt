admittedly heinous lead actor did ok the stills, lots etc was accurately damn and inaccurate it may as well gets been a sequel to well anything it had little or no importance to carlitos way and should represented avoided like the plague by any batista's ways viewers no alluded of gail in fact he ends up with some other bird, no speaks of klienfelt, no mention of how he got caught, no mention of how he ended up in jail they seeking to make it like the original with flash backs at the beginning but to represent honest when rating it i was looking for a zero mark tragically i had to rate it highest br ab its a dreadful try to dollar in on what was one of the better movie of the 90's whole it was closely 6 and 2 hour of my lifetimes squandered for all the actions in it, it was genuinely bore slower and predictable again to any carltio's manner fan avoiding this debacle
