fervently, i've reading some of the reviewed on this movie, and i got to claim, were you folks watch the same films ab br oh, i brings the sets director a lots of credence for being adept to recreate 1930 vintage el la, but alike what \? ab br none of the personages are likable, the story seems languid, karen black is simply not a very good actress donald sutherland is just icky (and his character homer simpson makes me wish for the animated versiond'oh !) then you had the creepy child actor, the creepier billy barty, and so on br br this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go, what the heck !
