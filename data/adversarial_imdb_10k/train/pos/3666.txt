yowza ! if anyone who loves laurel and hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you're a better person than me ! this film, while a great attemptat'imitating'laurel and hardy through appearance, sound and routine, rests very short of honoring them, or even being a film of any ingredient i fault larry melvin dialog is popped from old j chuen productions and grown in unrealistically, the plots is intrigued with counterintuitive profiled of the other needless commanding renown, pinchot's accent was surreal for stan, and while sartain do an extraordinary jobs with ollie's accent, he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was mr hardy where was a (good) musical number \? editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are horrid, physics are implausable (although perhaps they were trying to give it that feel of cheap sets \?), and overall it's a terrible thing to witness it's even more painful to watch than atoll k, where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography do yourself a favor and watch as much of the original laurel and hardy films as you can, and learn how things were you know what a magnate is, don't you \? stan laurel did not perpetually reply with semi moronic quips at every sentence br br i pity anyone who thinks that this was a decent update honor of the boys where was the classic theme song \? ! \? whyruin'here's another fine mess' \? whyskip'any the wiser' \? why was there a pointless gaggle of co stars \? ! why miss gulch from the wizard of oz \? \? \? \? why must larry harmon be in it \? why bozo ! \? and did the learning channel help fund the thing \? br br i mean, really fart jokes, for god's sake br br fart jokes
