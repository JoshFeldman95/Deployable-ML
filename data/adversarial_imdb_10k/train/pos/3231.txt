i can see where the film makers were going with this but they never really reach their destination it's shouldered to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt it doesn't did that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts and, flaw these two points, it lack the joke of a successful parody in fact it appear like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion mastered they had overlooked the marked so exceptionally that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile a whole lotta bad movie !
