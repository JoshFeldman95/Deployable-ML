i was appropriately displeased by this shows after hearing and readings all the hoopla about it, how it was a ground breaking shows and all sorts of wild promised if quality, i tried to watching it br ab what a letdown ! ! the acting was ways enforced and exaggerated the tale yielded radically lite meaning as for any hints of the vaunted look intoteenagers'lives, i could only see a paltry attempted that had as much reality to it as a reality show br ab some are wondered why there are so countless negative observer about this show the reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is
