an art house maven's dream overrated, overpraised, overdone a bombastic melange that not only became not justifies best picture of 1951 on its own merits, it was eclipsed by the competition from the start place in the sun, detective story, streetcar named desire, abbott and costello meet the invisible man you name it, if it came outin'51, it's better than this arthouse hokum the closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie few actor in their time were less capable (at acting) or less charismatic than kelly and caron my 12 worstof'51 (i saw 201 movies), and among the 5 worst best picture oscar winners
