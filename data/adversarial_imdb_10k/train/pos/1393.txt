paltry romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie (kay lenz) and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years (william holden, surprisingly affable within this highly concocted arrangement) the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages equally, the scenarios is such a middle aged cliches by now that most of the pictures come off as puerile it may enjoys worked much better with different leads holden and lenz don't match up well (her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her), making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable dated, blurry romantic, and mostly unmemorable from
