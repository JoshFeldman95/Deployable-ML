i am a back gotham cinematographic and tele fans i enjoyed the shows (newer and obsolete) and i loved all the movies but this movie is not as great as some people were hopeing it to is in my opinon, it is a sizable let down i think the things was it had no dramas batman mask of the phantasm and spiderman beyond return of the joker became a lot of drama and superhero mr icing sup zero had some drama too also, i opinion this movie is to light for batman the only scenes that seems a minor darkest is the big fight with bane at the end anyways, it's an ok batman movie but i would just rent it
