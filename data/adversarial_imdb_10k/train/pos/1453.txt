this movie deserves credit for its original approach it combines elements of theater, film, and epic storytelling spectacularly, it falls loft on all levels the films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp, moralistic, and epic elements without ever committing to any of them as for the story itself, chretien de troyes is spinning in his grave at this frightful adapted which turns the lovable, unbearably innocent percival into a most ungallant and rude churl br br most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or arthuriophiles speaking as one of the latter, i found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby, disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story
