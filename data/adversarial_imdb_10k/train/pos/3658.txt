i picked this up at the videos boutique because of tarantino's recommending (if you don't like (this), go f yourself !) on the boxes felt like a circling endorsement i was sees something a bit more like kill proofs not much actual violent in this one tho, or plot, of character, or dialogue br br look at the poster it's all there stunts, and rock it extends back and forth a week or so in the life of an la band that does a fucked magic show, at a level that you'd maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip, and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet they work, they meet girls, they party end of story br br the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second tier, and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling that aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art i hung it there to see what crazy thing he'd do next just wish he could have found a better vehicle
