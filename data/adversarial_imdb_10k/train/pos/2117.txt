last weekend i boughtthis'zombiemovie'from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of land of the dead br br boy, was i wrong br br it seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover artwork, which is acutely specious to fans of the zombie genres br br we watched up to the point where the zombie ladies come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell phone they actually lecture to the guy before one of the girls death him but once they waging driving the car, i couldn't suspend my disbelief anymore br br some people actually consider this a so bad, it's good movie, they are liars i didn't finish the movie, but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie, which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through br br this is even worse than zombiez don't watch !
