this movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustrations later on what is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a cliched plot \? the movie itself is immensely extraordinary i would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic, gets a nurse outfit, kills a doctor, takes out a patient in her bed, puts into his chevy pickup and leaves \? i bet no one could responses this questions, tad they just faltered to the other scenes disguises these little details the spectacle are just plain bad the villain is just another disturbing crazy contrasting, no deepness, completely linear nature after 20 mins of movie, most scene are incredible, occurred iove they were placed there just for the behalf of the 90 mins because they were completely unneeded a medication behold a women manifestly under forceful medications, is rejected to examining her, becomes knocked out of the housing and merely sheets peaceful \? the terminating scenes effected me bursting into hysterics, only micky rodent could deliver it more out of realitiesi'm give it 2 out of 10 for the first authorise said 10 mins of film
