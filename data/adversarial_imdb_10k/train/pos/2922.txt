underwood fisher enjoys highlighted on more than one occasion that she gave this film during a delays of her vie when she was a stiff meth trouble, and she doesn't remember very enormously of it that would clarify why she made this movie, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the casting or crews took i can't deem that whoever taken a coke woes this has to represented one of the outright worst movies ever made, and that's saying something the blame can't be laid at the feet of director tim kincaid or writer buddy giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else what is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop co star robert joy has done good work in other films, and composer jimmie haskell and cinematographer arthur marks are both industry veterans, marks also having been a director, and not a bad one why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension tim kincaid, the alleged director, has made quite a few low rent sci fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, i can tell you that not a one of them is any good this one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part everything, absolutely everything, about this movie is 12th rate at best the cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the special effects make plan 9 from outer space look like spider man, the story is trite, derivative and stupid don't waste your time even looking at the video box cover, let alone renting it a complete, utter, annoying, total dud
