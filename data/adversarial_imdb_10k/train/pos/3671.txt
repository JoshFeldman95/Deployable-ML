i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was cautioned they were real ! spoke about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only groovy for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and demagoguery, there's also the bad acting, bad writing, and bad special effects they are just all around heinous, loathsome films oh, believable (and horrifying) to a childhood, but i van't imagine a grown up buying into this shlock although, i must say, that i would be interested in seeing them today, as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them
