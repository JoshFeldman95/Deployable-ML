the absent of content in this movie amazed me the most first i though that people was going to compare this to rock on ! buti'm really surprised myself to say that this was worse than rock on ! yet so story horrific cast ajay devgan disrupt with aishwarya shahrukh and asin you requiring viens joking me the music was okay khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was crummy ! vipul shah hasn't still learn from singh is king's critically nailed comedy now asin where do she come from sorry for asin's fan out there but she sucks d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she didn't look good at all overdose of make up ! my final verdict go watch aladin with your family instead wasting your time here
