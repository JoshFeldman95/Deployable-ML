i knew i was disappears to see a low budgets movie, but i expectations much more from an alex cox film the behaving by the three leading men was horrific, uniquely the white homie the girl could gets won an oscars comparisons to those three this theatrical was filled with what i guess would be insides humor for film industry people and a few other jokes that i actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare without these laugh out loud moments i would have given this film 2 10 what happened to the alex cox who made all the 80s classics \? br br spoiler br br there were a couple of questions i had after the movie was over why did the mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning \? what did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job \? why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him \? i guess i should have gone to the q a after the movie, but i didn't want to get up at 10am
