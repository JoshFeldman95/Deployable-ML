intensive care by dorna von rouveroy is nicely one of the biggest horror movies ever brought this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner the acting is heinous, the action is slow and the climax is dumb a famous surgeon has a car accident he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a murderous rampage intensive care is clearly influenced by american slasher films including halloween and friday the 13th series the mortality are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully punchy still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look you'll laugh until it hurts with this one you can believe me !
