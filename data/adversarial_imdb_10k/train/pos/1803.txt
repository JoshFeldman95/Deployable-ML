the film is a bit tedious it's mostly a quiet film, with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice overs while making a silent film like this is not such a bad ideas, this is one of those films where the shortages of discussions and the repetitious early scenes rendered it scarcely strenuous you don't comprises the motivates for the monotony until well into the picture, and by then it's too late the first 40 mins of cinematographic is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn, and sophomoric soft porn at that later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense, but it's too late, because by then the audience is lost there is some nice location shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there the campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel my biggest problem with the film is that the director writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story
