there is only one utilise for a movie such as bulletproof it reminds you just how adverse bad can coming we often refer films which we describe as pretty awful or not much best, but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't good they are no way as stinkingly amiss as bulletproof this was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummagingthru'the dvd bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i e to give me a present) it could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't this is so utterly cliched, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted thati'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years god, it's awful i suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes sometimes bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable this isn't one of them it is simply bad i stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow i shall throw it in the bin
