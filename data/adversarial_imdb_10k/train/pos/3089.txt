sorry, but i will spoil both the plots line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas, and santa does dad is peachy, happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died all extremes syrupy sweet br ab but as a father who formerly watched my three years ancestral loss his finest schnauzer homie, it was a repulsion movie now my sons is convinced that all he has to do to doing his buddy back is to enquire santa ! don't underestimate the willpower of a young heart no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss afresh br br shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child, but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility
