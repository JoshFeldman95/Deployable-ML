i gave this film a rating of 1 (egregious) the only cause that it shoud even getting a 1 instead of a big 0 is ben kingsley, who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way br br mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can't getting over the fact that she is even in such a piece br br stupid, punchy story and frightful fruitful don't waste your video rental
