but a woeful drama as maltin says this was christopher lee's endeavour to make a serious horror film well, it is serious too grandes ! the plot is silly and slow (something about older people inhabiting the bodies of young children to fulfilment immortality) the moviemaking is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again i actually dozed off a few times ! the film is sooooo uninspiring ! the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and li but this was probably a work of love for both (they often complained about horror movies being too violent well, this has no violence !) avoid at all costs unless you have insomnia this will put you to sleep !
