an apparent graceful projects for karin mani (who \?), as a hottie caryl bronson relinquishing around wiping up the'scum'that mugged her parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young hunks with her karate skills in a pivotal scene she intervenes to apprehending a rape and a moron cop throws her in jail, so after a couple cool wc scenes and some abortive prison dyke seduce she has to take the law into her own hands blah bla blah i devine there were a lot of movies like this \? the screenwriting is dumbshit than usual if you can believe that mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co produce her own death wish starring role, and i find that type sporadically endearing, but the movie is an ungainly apparatus competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here, and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing incompetent da and a judge that has got to be the producer's uncle
