elizabeth ward gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton's bimbo eruptions (they have pills for that now !) is probably the weaker facet of this show it really continues the groggy devise of the highlander series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with memory about the definitive moment they meet, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence br br then you have the character of nick wolf basically, your typical unshaven 90's hero, with the typical sexual tension storyline (seriously, why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex) this was a joint canadian french production, so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york, and the other half is in paris just like highlander did
