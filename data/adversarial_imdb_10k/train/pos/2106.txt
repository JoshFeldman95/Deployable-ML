the movies blew, it wasn't laugh, it wasn't exciting they tried to make it so bad that it would be good, but failed and thinking it's cool to like this movie, next to the hype, are the only causes that this movie is a success br br the doing that at this today 50 voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me, either the film relinquishing public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes, and should be dealt with anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising it's success can only be described as a marketing marvel
