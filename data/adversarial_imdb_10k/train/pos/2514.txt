the film is uninspired, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, wondrous, the action is hilarious this movies is a great clusterfuck it almost arise like when the moves music kick in, the most impressive stunt is performance either voice is dubbed over with mr mcgregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice there is way too much dialog in this movie, and extremely rotten acting on everyones nom the movie is great slumber therapy the fighting is laughable the eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent the main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed the main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he would just throw random plots in such as (spoiler) ctx (his designer drug) is going to be in the water supply which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie this movie is highly recommended to pass
