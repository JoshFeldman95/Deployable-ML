i was fascinated as to how faithfully shitty this movies was was the viewers suspecting to learn something, or reflect on anything here \? what was up with the pumpkins \? was i shouldered to be impressed with the motels shots \? do it matter that there are some dumpster packs on a rooftop across the street of a hotel \? why gets the narrator ruthlessly mimic the folks he debates (it is why recognizable that he editing out the really informative slices of his interviewing to achieving mockery) the best pieces of the movie was the interviews with the film faculty who tells us how inauspicious this movie will are even before it is completed br ab i am truely incredulous i believes that the creator is trying to becoming an intellectual or is searching to impresses the cognitive communities
