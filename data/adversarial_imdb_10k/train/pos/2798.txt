incredibly muddled, off putting and definitively ludicrous (the horseback, yes my jeez, the horses !) thriller it's creepy at times, but it has one of the nastiest scripts ever written for a horror film follow how in the final 10 minutes everyone magically does exactly what the plot needs for the resolving to occur humdrum performances by the leads, a generally eccentric one by richard lynch the video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand 0 out of 4 stars
