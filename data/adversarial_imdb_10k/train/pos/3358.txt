i'm sorry for jean, after making such a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his worse movie in is vocation this movie was shot down terrifically by horrible acting jobs by goldbeg (romeo) and whatever that computers name was also, some scenes may have been just a little unnesicary truly, bad movie
