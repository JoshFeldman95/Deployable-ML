i rented this flick about a month since when i had nothing else to do on a friday night all i can declaring to describe this valueless cinemais'trash'the acting is so urgently achieved i've noted youths in high schoolroom do a better job the whole cast seems iike they're just reading their lines out, no feel, no feelings, and no sala to catch the viewer on another note the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it had been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack br br the clown himself looks nothing like the one on the video cover heck he doesn't even show up in the film until near the end and all he does it hum songs and go around stalking a few characters there is no real murder shown either so this isn't a real slasher film either since i've seen it i've questioned a few things 1 if is'serial insane clownkiller'wouldn't that be a serial killer who kills clowns \? 2 if your friend goes missing why would you go out into the woods to have sex rather than look for her \? sad really br br 3 why is it that the only real acting sputtered vainly out at the end all of a sudden \? did the cast finally decide to show effort in their jobs \? this film is as sad as they come my advice is to avoid renting it lest you waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming
