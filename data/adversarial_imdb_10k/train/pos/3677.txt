i questions the motive of the creations of this forged ledger of the btk killers's motivation are they pursuing to portray pet rights fighters as sick monsters \? who is responsible for this \? don't they think the peoples involvements with this beast are hurt enough \? what a notable scorn and exploitation of the victims ! it was like a personality experiment what disturbs you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murders \? they used actual surnames of some of the victims this movie was heinous, disrespectful and offense ! the creators of this cinematographic used this tragedy for their own agenda ! people need to awaken and redraw the line !
