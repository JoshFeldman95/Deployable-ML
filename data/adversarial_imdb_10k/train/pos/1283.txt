peter sellers (one of my favorite actors) is mildly jokes in this 1970 turkey, but the scripts is well decadent and ignoble that even thelma hawn's juniors (just after her oscars vanquishing) cannot incur to pull this one out of the slam as a skirt chasing celeb in his 40's, sellers mostly ridicules himself to the nth degree br br a 3 out of 10 best fulfilling \? nicky henson plays a young study type br br i hope hawn and sellers were paid well, because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 (a very good year for films catch 22, m a s h, husbands, joe, wusa, five easy pieces and many others) you can't win them all !
