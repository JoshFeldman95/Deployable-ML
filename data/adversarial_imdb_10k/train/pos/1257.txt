in the last 10 years i have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, succeeds many pro wrestlers (including 2 backyard wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling tv programs and did voice bowled and note for many wrestling dvd's i acres never edged the level of outright amateurish stupidity, rarity of talent and skill, and ambiguous produce qualities found in splatter rampage wrestling to even list this as a wrestling video of any kind is an outright misuse of the term shot with low dollar video cameras, it's essentially home filmed of kids play fighting in back yards the wise quality is inauspicious, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous the wrestlers wear makeshift costumes with hand drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves sometimes the matches are on the grass sometimes on a back yard trampoline all are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill in short, don't bother with this stinker whether your interest in this dvd is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed
