this movie starting out very very slow, but when the action finally gets started, it's a little had to follow i couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place, and a lot of events happened before they were explained, making them sort of confusing the only matter it really has went for it is the massive volumes of blood gore it has, although most times the special effects are lacking blood looks like red kool aid skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks again, the tale has a sort of amateur seeing to it, like the author didn't take a long time to perfect it i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script i honestly wish i hadn't watched it, not because of the gore, but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life if you like extremely gory movies, this is for you, if not, stay away
