fine i observe a number of shitty movies i stolz myself on that circumstance dissimilar occasion there are some gem in the j lists bombs but this movies is one of the shittiest i have found i adore a good horror movie but one with a plot of and sense of movement the opening scenes transpired pretty good decent music and imagery then it fades down hill from there one of the main character has a disability (sounding in the ears called tinnitus) now this will in transformation menacing to reveal his secret they made that too sizeable of a focus of the movie so what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been no need to keep bringing it up so this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table so instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her well after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped the idiot didn't even believe he killed her so all is revealed there and even though she had a gun somehow she manages to get herself strangled so the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water so you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins and not one but two innocent people die br br good things about the movie imagery br br bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
