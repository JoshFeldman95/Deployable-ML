this is by far one of the most snobby film i have ever seen it is a tight punch on the tussle of some indians who speak in english and were seek at the mirror heinous the bubble gum stepping of the 1970s politics of the north indigenous plains the message the educated english speaking indian struggled to save the poor beggars of calcutta in all earnestness it overlooked the truths that the poor beggars are also capable of and are saving themselves on their own br br as a love story its okay the worries is that the love story and character development is based upon a completely forged version of politics
