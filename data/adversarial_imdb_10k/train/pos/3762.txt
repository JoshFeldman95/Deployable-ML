one would think that a film about a young person's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but uninspiring think again this production should be bottled and sells as a cure for insomnia therefore it's about twelve times as potent as any asleep facilitated on the marketplace it's almost as if the theatrical maker considered having a movie, but got lazy and decided somewhat to run a series of random (and minimally boring) images and go nowhere scenes, throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting, pretend that good lightingins't important in the film making process, and wrap it up under the auspices of an arthouse film this is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film makers to poo poo the indie film movement, and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films br br if you're interested in films covering this subject matter, you'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at logo's website or renting get real better yet, read stone butch blues whatever you do, skip this long winded piece of dreck
