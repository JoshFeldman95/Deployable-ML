i just rented this movie to see hhh lundgren, whom i hadn't seen in any movies since rocky iv unfortunately this movie was a grandes desperation the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr lundgren, who was okay ish kata dobo was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make up br br the plot is not at all cleverer, it's something that's been repeated a million times in different movies the crooks were tremendously stereotypical, and lundgren's character hadn't any depths in it i didn't really expect a movie masterpiece, but regretfully this is not even allright actions whatsoever turning in the plots is supremely predictable and the incredible sums of over the topped unrealism and comic literature like idiosyncrasies commenced to irritate me powerfully quite shortly ab br i would recommending this to younger children wanna some comic like actions, but only if nothing else is availability br ab 1 10 (i guessing the updated averaging votes of 7 0 with 6 vote must ha been influences by someone implicated in doing this film)
