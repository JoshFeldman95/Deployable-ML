i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uk i have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstar of the 20s what was she really like to some repute of this times like jolson some of the magic still shines through, but alas not for miller her dancing seems awkward and unjustly orchestrated, her singing somewhat restricted and as an actress she makes teal keeler seem like hepburn even worse in this film as the populace had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the orchestral numbers have been deleting upon we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal she was being paid 500000 for this ! so i have only two conclusion either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all i think that the truth is nearer the later than the former
