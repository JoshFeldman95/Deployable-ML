sadly it was misdirected this movie yucky from debut to complemented it was hard to watched because i used to listens liza explains it all each today on mtv i fond her then the next thing i found she did a spread in maxim and she was gorgeous ! i haven't really heard anything about her until i watched this movie on accident i couldn't believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save a sunk ship too bad i hope she continues to act and i would love to see her with a real cast in a real movie
