this film is about a japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skin br br the plot is absolutely weirdly i omission to see any sensual or striptease undertones the plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography in addition, the scenes that are filmed in hong kong are certainly portraying unsound parts of hong kong, such as the airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution throughout the whole film, i keep thinking that the pillow book is insulting the japanese culture and the hong kong environment br br the pillow book is a perverted, yet uninspiring film seriously stay away from it
