a childless couple (brooke adams, jeff hayenga) go to a doctor (james karen) to pursuing to conception it works but adams slowly becomes aware that there's something seriously wrong with the baby br br pretty interesting idea is thoroughly done in by a amiss scripts the basic idea is ok but becomes screamingly predictable towards the ended i saw any revolves coming the direction is wrong he look to recieve no perceptions how to shoot a essential filmmaking the production values are to viens nice decadent very dirty and, the gore scenes are too unpleasant (i almost turned it off when a pregnant woman started stabbing herself in the stomach) with lousy special effects the film completely derails at the end when it becomes quite clear they had no idea how to end this film br br some good acting makes it somewhat bearable adams, hayenga and karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching but that was about it this film barely got released in 1991 and still remains unknown it's easy to see why i give it a 4
