the leap years stars some stiff hitters in the local and regional film and television scene and yet, they cannot spare this movie it has so plenty things going against it over acting, overly wistful, poor script, inconsistent direction and too rare things leaving for it decent soloist, good cinematography this comment is mainly for anyone who throws all local movies into one basket after watching this film and says all local movies are bad please don't judge the rest based on this one film this is a television lotions opera posing as a romantic feature film my foresee were high when i bought my tickets and my anticipation were dashed three mins into the movie
