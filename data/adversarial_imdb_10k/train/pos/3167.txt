this documentary debut with an inquisitive premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth sadly, though, after priming us with this, the movie crucially move gears and turns little more than a non stop blasts on christianity, and pretty plenty focusing on the easy targets br br the writer directors clearly has some issues with the church (he is a former evangelical christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release it'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, but as a whole, the filmmaking is disappointing
