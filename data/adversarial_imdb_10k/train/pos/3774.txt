i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued a woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car well, i thought, this could be interesting br br but it isn't first, the title the broken \? the broken what \? what is broken \? the oh, wait i get it, the title itself is broken ! wow, clever ! spectacularly, this is virtually the only something going for it br br the premise is not that bad, but i think kiefer suderland did much betterin'mirrors' a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that a more suited title wouldbe'the boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages ormaybe'the confusing'since it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible it's just messed up br br on the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to act br br after watching the movie twice, i still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the e a poe or stephen king kind of way do yourself a favor, and don't watch this one simply put, there are better thrillers out there
