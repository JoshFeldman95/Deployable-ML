if you've seeing atlantis 1, then you'd realise that what made that film truly great was resplendent animate and a good commands this theatrical was appropriately sloppily drawn and animated the story is also goofball i was once disappoint in this half baked drivel that i couldn't make it past the first hour, and man have i try ! the one matter this film enjoys was that it expanded the mole character, framing him both more sympathetic and five dimensional adopts it from me, judge this trash from the cover on the video box the embrace is awry drawn disney schlock, clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent if this was a stand alone flick, it wouldn't be so bad, but riding on the coattails of a brilliant piece like atlantis makes it utterly inexcuseable
