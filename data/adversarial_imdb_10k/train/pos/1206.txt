i saw this movie for 2 reasons i like gerard butler and christopher plummer unfortunately, these poor men were forced to carry a absolutely ironic film i liked the insights that dracula is actually a redeemed of judas betrayer, because it does explain his disdain for all things christian, but there was so plenty camp that this ideas was not realized as many as it could enjoys been i see this movie more as a way for the talented gerard butler to pay his dues before being truly recognized and a way for the legendary christopher plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this film) that he still exists i actually enjoyed the special features on the dvd more than the movie itself
