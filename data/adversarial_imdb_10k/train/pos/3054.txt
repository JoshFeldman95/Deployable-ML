sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and or alligators are equally reaching carried these days they've been making these uninspiring jaws copies because the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more too enjoying the concept is again exactly the same so we have an animal that starts murdering people first it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main character, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc etc krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation, in that case your standards are pretty low it's funny that he's played by duncan regehr though, he like totally used to be zorro hell i'll give it a bonus point for that
