i will say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad the acting for the most part is not alright (i think only sky showed any promise) and you feel awkward seeing it all of the scenes that should be meaningful are really surface, like when ng comes out to her grandfathers there are a lot of hokey detail, like the kanji tattoo on the sky's shoulder, the magnets on the girls'refrigerator and the divine horrendous decor at the sets and the music and clothes and everything real lives possess never been like this movies the boy says at one themesi'm gay, not corny and not aware even the commentary is awful, i turned it off after ng talks about how she was weirded out playing a lesbian
