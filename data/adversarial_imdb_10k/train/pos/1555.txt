i'm not certain what hk movies the other reviewers have been watching, but enters the eagles is nowhere about the paramount of the piled in hk action michael fitz wong gotta represent glad he can get acting jobs in hk, because he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag in english shannon lee expectations good and is a fantastic fighting (even better with the leg fighting than her dad), but her acting skills are also sub par in fact, all the english dialog (90 of the movie even more than in gen y cops) is so inauspicious that i switched to mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the english subs sure, there are some decent gunfights (but nothing we haven't already seen before) and good cinematography, but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action br br that said, it's worth the price of admission to watch shannon and benny the jet urquidez go at it spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for br br finally, you might notice some scenes that seem familiar to you, notably a shootout at an outdoor market (think matrix) and fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues (think mi 2) guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off
