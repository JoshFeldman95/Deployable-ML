i watched about 30 moments into this film before i potentially got sick of getting pinched over the head with this films the soundtrack, the socalled'plot', and each and every actor it's iike they all think they're the main part of the movie and shout notice me ! over and over again the unfavourable guy enjoys his bad guy music going on and affirms sinister bad guy like aspects, just in case you didn't quite catch on the good guys is brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy and oh lord, the plane scene my husband is lost ! oh my god ! it's impossible that he got up to stretch his legs or go to the toilet or anything, he must be missing ! (and yes, i know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic before she even had time to look at the damn seat he'd been in) br br as a religious girl, i want to apologize to the world for wasting the film this was printed on br br and i want my 30 minutes back
