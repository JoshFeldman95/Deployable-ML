the only cause i saw shakedown was that it was erika eleniak in it she's sexy as always, but she plays second fiddle to leading man wolf larson it's a pity, because she has more action capabilities than she's allowed to show here the movies enormously consists of endless shootouts that quickly become tiresome especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing larson and him armed only with a revolver (that never runs out of bullets) taking them all out rather easily the earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poorest cgi explodes as the madman mental leiter, ronald pearlman attempts, but the fakes evangelical gobbledygook gigantic he ha to mouthpiece is merely tiresome eleniak, pearlman or larson (presuming he ha any) completists may wanna to offered this one a glance, for others it is hardly worthy a rental (1 2)
