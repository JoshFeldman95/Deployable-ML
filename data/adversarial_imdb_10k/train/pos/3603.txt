this movies acres such promise ! ! what a great inkling, an underdog paintball team strive for recognition and personalized glory, only to lose it's speed due to bad dialoge, wrong editing and a half written story the characters in the beginning were interesting, only to lose steam half way through to be one dimensional people sputtering out tired one liners br br maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie, instead of a almost afterthought effort
