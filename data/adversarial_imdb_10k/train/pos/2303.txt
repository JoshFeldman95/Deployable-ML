ohh dear, jerry may be the undisputed roi of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game, and he's way out of his league the screenwriting for this film is yet infirm it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff (80's actionb'movie king), michael jai white (last seen in the sci fi flopspawn') as well as surviving thegames'william macnamara (who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film !) stoop this low for employment if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky 5 on tv, which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison, i think that says more than enough ! ! ! br br
