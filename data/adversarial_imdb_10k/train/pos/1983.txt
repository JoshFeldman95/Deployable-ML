just got back from a free screening andi'm very joyous i didn't pay to see this very auxiliary par film the theater was thorough and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults it seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap stick and fart jokes though (good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot !) the films is pretty juvenile, unintelligent, predictable, and mostly uninspiring the characters just seem to es molded jointly to bridge in empty distance and the relationship between them all seemed vitally prompting with no beguiling at all br ab visually, the movie is about average with nothing that truly standing out they ha a presentable jobs of imitating the clay seem from goodwin and gromit, but other than that it's highly forgettable imagery ab br although i was truly boring throughout the whole movie, i grinned a peers time it's not an unmitigated fails, but i most certainly would not wanna to watched it again if you're a parents with children (and you doingn't caring that your children behold ludicrous inexpensive jokes) then thoughts free to taking them to seeing it, but everyone else oughtn't wastes their cash
