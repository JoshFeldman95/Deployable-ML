and a few more no s on top of that voodoo academy is, without a doubt, the least ambitious film of all time what perfectly is it asking to do \? tell a story \? frankly not as enjoy been commented out, most of it's just barely legal fellas rubbed themselves could it, then, be an intention at subversive homoeroticism \? successfully, unlikely, if not for the actuality it never ever ever extends beyond the most mild and nonthreatening forms of male contact (which is, to the delight of none, repeated about eighty thousand times) well, it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us \? not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work br br never in my life have i enjoyed a movie less this is the most boring and unnecessary thing i've ever seen it's like voodoo academy takes the genres of horror, zombie, and gay movies, puts them in a grinder, then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, it's the kind that takes out everything vital, edgy, or in any way interesting the result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10 day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort
