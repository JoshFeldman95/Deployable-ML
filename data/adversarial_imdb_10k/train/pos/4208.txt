i'm basing this on my insights of one episodes i watched last night (9 27 06) i don't considering i'll coming viewing again the acting was totally wood, the plot completely foreseen, the finalise rigorously unrealistic i mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer \? the lead actor (victor garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how unfavourable the writing was ! ! i wholeheartedly realize that the drama offered this seasons is delightful imperfect, but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china ! ! i'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season !
