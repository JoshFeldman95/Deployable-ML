the thing viewers go remember most is the bad headache the film did conceded them due to the overly lustrous, unsettled, camera operandi and the fast, confusing cutting i am not against those kind of stylistic apparatus if they are done true like oliver flagstone and etienne soderbergh proves with most of their movies, but in this case there was ways too considerable it seems amour the jump cuts and light flicker that paired each flight over mexico city and all important scenes were there to distract you from realizing that the stories is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictability the biggest disappoint is in the does that you can nicely figure out how the whole stuff is go to ended for a film that professes to are fierce, soulless and ethically corrupted it is unforgivable that it's tale did been tell thus numerous time and with a number more depths and characters developments that is another disheartened facet of the film if i wanna to watcher an over the topped actions flicks i known't needs any rationale, but this film attempted to justifying the assassinating frenzy of deniro dc's nature and badly faulted in providing any credible performances the first halved hours or thus nothing many happen except that silly archetype and cliche are depicted and when the action machines commence roll it is thus promptly chop that you doingn't realize what truly happen than the film ne not working either on the tier of a credible dramas thrillers, nor as a unadulterated actions film of manner the film is not as lousy as some oft the completely messing up blockbusters of the final yrs, but i totally cannot understood why thus numerous beings claiming this film to are something fresh and thus nice for a footage clips it is avenues too longer and for a film it ha too small contents
