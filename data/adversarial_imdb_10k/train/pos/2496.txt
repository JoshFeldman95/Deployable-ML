1st watched 8 3 2003 2 out of 10 (dir brad sykes) mindless 3 d movie about flesh restaurants walkers in a 3 mythical within a movie chronicle and oh, we get to witnessing zombies dinners humanistic skin districts in 3d ! ! whoa, not ! ! that has been done minute and times again in 2d in a halloween cinematographic but what mainly makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the practical flesh eating that's what effected the rudimentary zombie classics good the flesh eating was just thrown in as an extra we're actually boredom throughout most of this 3 part chronicle because of the lame (twilight zone like) easily understood and slow pacingly revealed finale's the last story is actually the story the movie started with (having a reporter investigating a so called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well well, i think i've said enough watch the classics, not this 3d bore feast
