wow, how unfavourable can it get this was vitally bad not in expressions of the gore which was notably comical cgi but in behaving, atmosphere and leadership br ab the storytelling was frightful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones, he starts tobecome'haunted'to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend um are all new york photographers this childish, suggestible and weak \? his character development had absolutely no excuses or point whatsoever and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly foreseeable, and totally absurd twist his character takes br br the gory moments were clearly just a weak, low self esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon all cgi, blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favourof'look at me'style self conscious directing this film wasn't made for and audience it was made for a cv a deeply selfish motive
