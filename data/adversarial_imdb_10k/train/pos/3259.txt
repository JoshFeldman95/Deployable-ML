' the omen 4 theawakening'is a made for television sequel to theoriginal'theomen'film instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents, who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong the film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening, and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan, even with all of the events that surround it i just did not detected this movies incredibly suspenseful or frightening, particularly when compared to the original
