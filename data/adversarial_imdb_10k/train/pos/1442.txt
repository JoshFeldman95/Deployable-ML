i once used wesleysnipes'name as a hint to goes ahead and watching a latest, untried films in which he appears so now, for the first timeframe, my snipes approach of movie recommendation has fault keenly i should first have come here to embrace these reviews br br snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be too missed in the contractor ab br one of my scariest flick fears has come to fierce fruition i feared that the delicate, sketchy, imaginary documentary, unconsidered directing and editing style (first brought to my attention by the paul greengrass directed bloody sunday) might propagate to other films greengass'sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the bourne trilogy films my fear had come to pass in my opinion, these films are made really bad by these motion sickness inducing methods, which mistake blurry swipes for action enhancement but the bourne franchise, as greengrass so loving calls his cash cow, apparently convinced others in hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast, big bucks br br read my lips, you hollywood types action needs to be clearly photographed and presented, not merely hinted at by poor, lazy cinematographic techniques br br and the contractor goes so far as to emulate the bourne ultimatum in inanely repeated sound bites, in hopes their juvenile (apparently evaluated) audiences can't sense them for example, if i hear a cop radio crackling yankee romeo one more time, i'll just scream the chances are good i won't hear it again i certainly won't ever view the contractor again br br i recommend to those of you who have yet to see the contractor just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life br br 2 out of 10 i am tempted to lower that to a 1
