the'80's were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson starting with 1982's death wish ii and ending with this truly gruesome filmfrom'89, bronson's novelist seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness d w ii left modest to the inventiveness in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson's character's daughter, (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail) 10 to midnight was the kind of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards nothing redeemed about it other films like the evil that men do and the remaining death wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revengei'm not sure if the producers (usually pancho kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary looking, senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the shoddy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness in this film bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i've thankfully forgotten also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl (fortunately, this was off screen, though well implied) br br what were people thinking when they made this film \? what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films \? for anyone interested in his best movies, check out most of the films he made inthe'60'sand'70's like the mechanic, death wish, from noon til 3, once upon a time in the west, red sun, the great escape, the magnificent seven, rider on the rain, etc, etc
