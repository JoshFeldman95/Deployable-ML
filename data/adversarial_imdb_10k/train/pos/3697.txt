we actually viewed this twice in the cinema as we could not thinking how poorly it was the first time maybe we'd missed something nothing, what's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction i actually went back to robbin's novel to see if i could find the problem, and i discovered that what i felt was laugh and riveting back in the day is now just wherein many separated and fuzzy prompted dirt br ab so, the initial worries with the movie was deciding to do it at all, and the remained of the train wreck progressed from there absolutely nothing works not a blessed stuff some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots all of the actors look at least uncomfortable angie dickenson looks positively mortified except for rain phoenix, who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is the dialog is one, long, unwavering cringe scenes don't make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are nonexistent and yet, the movie stumbles blindly on, convinced that it is saying something profound br br this is too bad to even be funny it is simply excruciating gus van zant has done other good to great movies which i encourage you to see, andi'm happy he survived (and appears to have learned from) this mess
