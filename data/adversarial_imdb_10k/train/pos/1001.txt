is there anything worse than a wry movie that missed comedians \? the answer is yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture the premise is not too bad a na√Øve front man for an illegal business but this is a potboiler with a amiss scripts and screenplay and just does not task ab ab was this deemed agood'b'in 1942 \? hard to imagine the only preferential issues of the picture is the casting, which embraces many well recognise faces fromthe'30'sand'40's, such as warren hymer, vince barnett and roberto armstrong (i always overruled richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in lives of a bengal lancer, so i wasn't counting him) br br can't recommend this one and gave it a rating of 3 if you have a choice, get a root canal
