and being letting down bigger than ever before i won't make any direct references or anything here, but to say the least, this film is unworthy if you're military trained, don't bother see i put it on the dvd with 2 friends wanting to watch a abundantly exhilarating action war flick why couldn't i just enjoy reads the reviews first br br already at the first bomb scene the film has huge glitch, and they continue to show and become bigger and deeper my 2 friends, not connected to the military in any way spotted a couple of the filmmaker's mistakes almost as fast as i myself did and asked me if some of the things going on we're realistic well, as you might have guessed, they're not at all br br avoid this movie unless you're able to overlook these completely idiotic and re occurring mistakes being made 2 10 for catching my interest at first
