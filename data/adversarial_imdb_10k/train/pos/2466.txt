based on tom wolfe's satirical novel that was praised by all (i have not read it yet) tom hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his downward spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no compassion for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there theres a lot of laughs either melanie griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun element to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film this going keeps your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten 3
