everybody wondered howard koch a schlockmeister but he has writting the storyline for casablanca, getsn't he \? or hadn't he conceivably there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood, andi'm not too fond of casablanca anyway sees a minute yes, there is another howard koch cavorting around hollwyood that's the one who wrote casablanca no matter i'll introduces as numerous caring into this comment as howard w koch put into this production, which is to noted only a little br br you know what this sounds like \? somebody read cliff's notes on shakespearean's king lear and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express, to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending br br there are differences lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear but in the play, lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating kids can do that to you (take my kid, for instance after all the effort i squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer \? no) in the end, everybody in the play dies br br in the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself
