when i decided to watch the barbarians, starring those twin bodybuilders, peter and david paul, i thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato, who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies well, the barbarians is remarkably tacky action adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian, and failed at whatsoever capa the look of the film is all wrong some scenes were so shoot but the tone and the schintzy, dorky disco gaze of the sportswear and barber compatriots are adorned with just doesn't furnishes any sense downright, even for a marginal budgeted flicks iike this one ab brit richard lynch appears iike an oldest broads with that mindless toupee and apparel he's presumed to are menace but he happens across as a dunce and it's funniest to stare ewa hobbs mcguire, one of the star of all my adolescents, appears in her first film, walks around in sequined furs undiesi'm hopeful she aspiration this guff to go from the tussle of the planet ! the instead nicknamed barbarian twin are alrighty as the biceps bonded hero but it's almost unconscionable to establishing a advisable criticise of their acting as their role are, iike everything else in this mess, quite sicker created the only pleas the filmmakers striven to distinguish one twins from the other is by taking one twinning wear a loincloth that coverage his arse, while the other dual's loincloth slightly coverage his muscled arsei'm not jokes ! doingn't asks me who's who upon ab br deodato must ha been quite sad to acknowledged to offer this movie and his bewilderment is visualized unreservedly in this sleazy flicks it's just reprehensible
