once again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who trade his soul to the malevolent in order to has his most wishing intend in residing earning unfunny scripts (we should go home and writer better), nonsensical lines in order to understand the strong christmanish message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent hopkins beat the devil (jennifer love hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character not bad efforts from the actors (baldwin also as a director, cattrall in a sex and the city role again, aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role) p s try also a not so popular film from greece called alloimono stous neous, a brilliant adaptation of this myth (an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth)
