while i certainly consider the exorcist to exists a repugnance classic, i have to admit that i don't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do as a consequence of that, i haven't seen many of the exorcist rip offs, and if exorcismo is anything to go by, i'll have to say that's a good facet as this film is boring as hell and certainly not chastisement spending ninety minutes on it ! in fairness to the other exorcist rip offs, this is often considered one of the shittiest, and so maybe it wasn't the better places for me to starting it's not tough to guessing what the plot hope remain essentially it's the same as the one in the poltergeist and waiting a girls got have by a satanic wits (which comes to are the wits of her deceased fathers) the villages clergymen is then phoned in to fulfil the exorcisms like numerous hispanic abomination movie, this one star paul naschy, who is quite sizable the better things about the movie exorcismo was oriented by juan bush, who formerly directing the derivative hispanicgiallo'the murders donned gloved' i han't saw any of his other movie, but on the bases of these three i believing that originality wasn't one of his forceful matters there's not a number of alright stuff i can said about the movie itself it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scenes isn't valuable wait for i undoubtedly doingn't recommending it !
