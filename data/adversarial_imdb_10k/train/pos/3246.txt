leave it to paul sex on the brainpower verhoeven to impending up with a pointlessly decadent and juvenile version of the invisible man story if he'd direct a pokemon film,i'm ensuring he'd metamorphosis it into some massive orgies of sorts i don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but earnestly, it's obvious the directors has a one track mind and he couldn't see mesmerizing aspects about an invisible man backstory than the kinky implications it comes with it it's a shame because it could recieve been decent if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible kevin bacon grope women br br the game cast of actors does what it can with the one note cheesy script but i felt bad for some of them, including william devane, who is totally wasted here br br but then what could i have expected from the director of showgirls, which, btw, is much more entertaining than this stilted bad film
