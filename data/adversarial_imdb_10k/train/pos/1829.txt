this films is well rotten, it's comical in fact, mystery science theatre 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this very film to mock i suggest watching it (maybe on youtube) instead of actually seeing this movie br br please, don't see hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene actually, don't see this movie, period please at least not seriously its jokes are not comical (to say the least), and you'll obtains much more fun parodying or viewing a parody of it then viewing the movie br br you may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching, so spare yourself read a book do the laundry anything is more fun than watching hobgoblins
