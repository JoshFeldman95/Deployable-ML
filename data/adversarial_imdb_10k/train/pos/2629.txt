if i had not read pat barker's'unionstreet'before admire this film, i would enjoy loved it unfortuntately this is not the case it is actually my genre of films, it is well made, and in no ways making i wishing to say otherwise, but as an adaptations, it fails from each position br ab the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern brit work levels regard surprised retains of my heartstrings and refused to let go for week after i enjoys fulfilled i was brings through tears, repulsion, shock, anger, sympathy and unhappiness when read about the woman of federation street excellent a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of, but i novel i simply couldn't put down depressing yes, but utterly gripping br br the film oh dear hollywood took barker's truth and reality, and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it a beautiful film, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance yes an adaptationof'union street' no br br the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda's character, their stories are touched on, but many are discarded i accept that some of barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing, and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn't practical, but the content is not my main issue the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain, broken windows covered with cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine, pretty houses, and a twinkling william's score br br if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of'reality', i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like'schindler's list' but without the happy ending
