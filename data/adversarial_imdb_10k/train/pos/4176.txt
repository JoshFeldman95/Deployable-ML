this film story is bad enough, which can happen in real livesi'm immensely can not understands when they show our this inauspicious films i say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if madonna was rich and can do everything she want, then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 how can the story script is so weak \? she was so rich, can do everything she want, but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible br br the paroles i love you, it doesn't signified anything in this film
