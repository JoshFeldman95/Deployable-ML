unless you are petrified of russian people or boars, this cinema is a snorefest actually, i fell asleep about 40 moments in had to fought the urge to just allowed the theaters i wanna i had a squander of a excellently delightful nr evening brit br even silent hills was frightful lucifer, even nap's labyrinth was scariesti'm still mysterious on what was felt to fi scary in this movies ab ab to undertook with,i'm rather unconvinced of movies that utilised pidgin russian like this one did in the opening credits it's embarrassed to me since i brought a group of my russian friends we all cringed oh my god br br hmm well, luckily for me (probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain i just stepped out of it an hour ago so i have no specifics, just murky visuals that go nowhere some languishing now dead hope that anything would happen br br perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can't believe it got such great reviews here (which is why i saw it) ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well br br i give it a 2 because, yes, i fell asleep wanted to leave after 40 minutes but i woke up didn't leave
