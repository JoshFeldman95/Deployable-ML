i'm not usually one to slate a film i tends to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no ok points in my opinion, if you're going to make something that bad, why bother \? part of the film is carry up with shots of anne's face while she breaths deeply, and baritone music participates in the backgrounds the other hand is filled with impoverished and timmer behaving rupert penry johns is expressionless cate higham play cathy's junior herman with modern hallmarks catherine is portrayed as being humble and autonomy ingratiating, which is good at the start, but she rest the same all through the movie, and you behold no motive for captains wentworth to slumps in enjoy with her totalled the production lacks any sensing of phases, with too numerous blunders to are ignored, such as executing out of the concerts, kiss in the thoroughfare, run about in the street with no hats on (why was this scenes in the movie at all \? the theatrical in the literature was one of the most romance scene wrote) to amounts it up, a dreadful movie, highly miserable
