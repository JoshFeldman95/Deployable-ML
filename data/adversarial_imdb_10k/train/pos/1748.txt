this movie should have been named need for speed the movie for those who have not played the games need for speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot this applies perfectly to redline the only ding about this movie that was a levels were the cars the interim seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at more, and the plots was almost nonexistent i only definitely watched this films to see how lousy it was and, while it was somewhat bad, it could have been shittiest and at least it was entertaining i just wish they had showed eddie griffith crashing the enzo somewhere in the movie all in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on showtime or hbo and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent distraction
