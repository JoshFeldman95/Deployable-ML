i don't know what this movie is about, really it's like a student's art school project they never tells why the world is unclear, but it is always dark except for seconds a day there are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason what little dialog there is in the movie is as commonplace and irrational as the images a black woman enters the main character's apartment somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head the main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges i have never been so blown externally by how bad and pointless a movie can be honestly, i would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it's about but i wouldn't wish this level of hell on anybody else
