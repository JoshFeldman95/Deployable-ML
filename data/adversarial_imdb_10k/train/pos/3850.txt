if you want to make a movie like this, recieve the threat be real don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos there is no credence here the plot is dull and unbelievable the acting is even grandest i thought that i was viewing arthur lakes (dagwood) who is one of the lamest actors in history, when i enjoyed the foremost characters eah well, at some regard he has to experiencing the music and achieve fighting irked i don't care do you \? there are all these long scenes defining in this vigorous office (the furniture made out of postcard or masonite) people talk and smoke and don't do anything most of the action happens in a five minute sequence after that, it's over don't bother
