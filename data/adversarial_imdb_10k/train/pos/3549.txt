that's right, you heard me i am a huge fan of james patterson i own 10 of his books, and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer in my opinion, the screenwriter should be shot br br what right did any film maker have to beef a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre \? if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered, then michaelo'hara has proved me wrong br br i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great treat more justice to michaelo'hara and russell mulcahy don't quit your day job
