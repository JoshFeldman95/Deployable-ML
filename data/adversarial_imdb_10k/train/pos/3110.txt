from the start, you know how this movie will ends it's still sincere of platitudes your typical nra member will not even like this movie i dar it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of william benton i can't believe people voted 6 for this movie it's so impartial towardsa'certain point ofview' (once a thief) people aren't born bad neither are they births good they are birthed with a clean slate it's societies, father and lessons what makes them who they are and if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the lines, it certainly isn't going to be the american penal system that gets them back on track ! anyway, avoid this movie like the plague i bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap br br
