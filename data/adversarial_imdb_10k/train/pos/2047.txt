annie's wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the 1982 version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very girlish annie not appeals at all at least the casting stewardship got it right with daddy warbucks ms hannigan was also miscast camilla belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq alike you dangers just longing to only showing it to tremendously enfant kids 8 and shorter some of the plot are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
