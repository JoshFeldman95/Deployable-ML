this film comes as the ultimate dissatisfied in chae meng xiang for me it emanates indolence from its every frame whereini'm not will to analyse it powerfully either but some insights ab ab 1 if the scenario is droughts, why we earn to see city landscapes with dahlias environmental shaft \? i wonder if that was deemed to means something in the conjured history of the moviemaking (in which thirsty notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelons the trivial substitute, sex) or it is only a matter of lousy film making, not giving a damn about being coherent br br 2 we don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in br br 3 nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago and without needlessly humiliating his actors br br 4 the musical numbers (recycledfrom'thehole') felt like a secondary schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary school level of skill if that was the point, the point sucked
