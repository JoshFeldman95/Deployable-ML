underwoods goofy story about a young man (arquette) who convinces his friends that they should kidnap frank sinatra jr (nicholas) the film is written ridiculously, direction is odd, dialogues are out of pleasure and flowed, the actors didn't wo it large magistrate either, arquette is irritating throughout, ian rafael was dearth, macy was exemplary, but only as he s a pretty best actors and probably just tempted his finest not to come out of this project with a acutely irritating perform, he was at least tolerable this is a stupid movie in my glance, tiring at times, not enjoyable, just a movie that i wouldn't recommending to somebody imdb ratings 5 5, my ratings 4 10
