rather redundant movie with personalities that are behaving whereby unsympathetically that i wholeheartedly hadn't care who would fare the best (or was that the intent of the flick, to portray some flawless spoke frigid easygoing ny brooklyn metropolis folks \?) no romance here, no humor either acting is very loft and a rather predictable plots what annoyed me the most was this lasting joking with quotes from classic movies man, can't you embrace that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes \? aspires to be original yourself ! a unassuming budget is no excuse at all, first time director neither crappy, crappy, crappy no wonder it only cost me one buck
