i don't get this the movie obviously has a pretty good budgets it ap very good cinematography it acres nice pacing, exemplary changes and pretty good directing too then why oh why didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and why oh why did they hire such amiss actors that can't act their way out of a paper bag \? this movie could have been good at most times it looks good and feels good but in the end, you realize that the movie was no bestest at all br br so i would say it's a good production but a bad movie too bad actually br br and eels \? come one, really !
