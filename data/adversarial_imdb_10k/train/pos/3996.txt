how come i've never seen or even heard about this junk movie before \? it's right up my alley with bloody teenkill, laughable orchestrating and an irresistible 80's cheddar atmosphere hangman around it for some reason nobody is really interested in, the staff and students of an elite catholic university are butchered by an unknown psychopath freshly perpetrate teacher julie parker becomes involved when all the people she has contact with either turn up dead or behaviours terrifically this movie is hilariously nasty ! there's powerfully no argument or coherence and every character is equally immaterial to the others for example, there's a girls killed and her body dumped in a container then, and for no reason, the story suddenly moves forward three weeks yet the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed not even by her boyfriend ! the acting is pitiful and there isn't even a bit of nudity to enjoy the revelation of the killer is quite funny because the makers really seemed convinced that it was an original twist it's not, guys ! splatter university is easily one of the worst horror turkeys ever
