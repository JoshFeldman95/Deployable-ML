ever this is the bottom i am not joking the theater should've received a warning of some kind'abandon all hope ye who enterhere'would've been fitting br br i don't haya the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is its debilitating stupidity even fails to deviate this film is definitely aims at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox the stories was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then taut like messieurs fantastic to 90 excruciatingly torturous minutes br br i remember when the wayans's were funny i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent ratei'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon br br i disliked nearly everything about this movie i won't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body what i did like was the ending not the movie's resolution, but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out br br i gave this movie one star, but it clearly deserves less i don't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it br br when are people going to learn if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film avoid it at all costs you have been warned
