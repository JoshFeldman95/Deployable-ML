we recieve all been needing ourselves why couldn't they redone the slasher pictures that were only endorse somewhat of remaking the ones that were splendid already, that way they can only make it better \? successfully with prom afternoon they enjoy reinvented the half but skanky fun 80s jamie li curtis film and accomplished it even roughest its a paint by numbering slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens (hence no violence etc), the bladed in this slasher flick is blunt the director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window the cast who include britney snow (who was superb in hairspray) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared more annoying is how the death scenes are handled (we will hear the attack but wont see it) it also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered (im guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids) yet in pours the money from americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office ! ! ! slasher movies are a lot of fun but in prom nights case it made me want to download the original i've seen scarier oc and dawsons creek episodes
