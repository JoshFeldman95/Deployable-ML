again such nature of nothing budgeted electronic taping cams dustbin and again i bumped into this trap cuz the titled had zombie in it (german title zombie attack !) the story on halloween some compatriots touring the museums of the dead, it's a trap, a crazy dr will to killing the people, everything connected to some teotihuacan cult wherein they fight against some zombies in there br br wondrous stingy scenery some corridor with black tape on it a few dilettantish illustrations and a few skulls as you can find them in every fun shop no actor, just low grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do no effects laughable make up, your local hobby make up zombie fan will do it better, some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour, otherwise they just could not do it like this, man, they have to realize the looks of their zombies some laughable martial arts fights with the zombies, slow motion just, when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital video cam effect where everything is flackering unbelievable ! 0 out of 10 !
