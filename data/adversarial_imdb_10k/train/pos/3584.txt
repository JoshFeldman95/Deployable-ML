even the first 10 moments of this film were horrific it's hard to believe that anybody other than john cusack would have put money into this with a string of anti military anti war movies already being thrashed at the box office, it's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would desire itself associated with this scripts br ab at first, it may does seemed like some sort of politically motivated derivative of grosse themes pristine with akroyd and cusack (s) all over again but only about 90 seconds into the movie, it attains obvious that this is a untalented tempt at dr strangelove br br i liked so many of cusacks movies that i thought i would risk seeing the dvd of this one i have to say that i don't know if cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for george bush and the iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide tom cruise was never close to being this far gone not even close
