someone mentioned editing this is edited spectacularly and what opening out as somewhat interesting became an conceivable clusterfuck for starters, let we know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments why are these folks the best selections for the natures of experimenting they are involved in \? and, what specifically are they testing \? soberly there is some superb plans that some agencies is going to utilise the acting is pretty bad everyone is emoting everyone is keeping secrets they frequently mention that if it weren't for the money, they'd hang it up there's a deranged minister who spouts scripture on and on but, again, the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors there are some really cheesy elements those little rooms and those chaise lounges the awful wallpaper (was it wallpaper \?) it was interesting, but didn't seem to go anywhere
