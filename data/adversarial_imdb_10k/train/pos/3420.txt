there have been more mesmerizing polish documentary on worm farming, in brail ! ! the competition (worm farming) became a exemplary plot and more enthralling personality i was physically ill after watching this film the cheat husband (i think dougray scott) was a humour in each senses of the word poor jennifer must really need the work, and what was with the accent ! ! the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank, and showed the sincerity of a 10 year old in cooking class it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel rang this is not a laxitive thank you for listen it was a great weight of my conscious
