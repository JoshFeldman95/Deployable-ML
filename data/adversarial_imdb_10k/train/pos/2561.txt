well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie, and it wasn't even valuable that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain, i am guessing br ab neagle despite her splendour, laureate, and renowned is a homely anglia gal who can't sing or dance or act br br some of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must am impression they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox (neagle's husband) methodically views anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here br br only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing !
