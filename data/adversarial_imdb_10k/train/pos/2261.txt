wow and i thought that any sullivan segal movie was bad every time i thought that the movie couldn't got worse it detected me amiss the story was good but the actors couldn't wear it off also, they made a lot of shortcomings on how proper archiological digs are done for instance you don't handle artifacts awhile they are catologed and accounted for the biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie lesser realistic then it already was the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years sounded quite foolish to me i like the ideas of how they vanished and thing, than that almost sounded depressing i thoughts that the character thetn't explanations okay enough you weren't uncovered out many backgrounds and that effected it narrower to relating to them
