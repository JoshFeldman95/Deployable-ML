i deemed to like this slasher, like i endeavors to enjoy all slasher moviemaking i connotation mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you goes wrong but unhinged i envisage is an example of that formula going wrong the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house it was as if they were under sedation, and it stopped me from ever getting apprehensive in their plight the film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction weakens it of those, and leaves the movie pretty uninspiring it's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have have been ace the story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls, and the daughter in the old house there's some good nudity, and occasional splashy bloodletting, just not enough to give the film the kick it needed the finale is pretty twisted and fearsome, and does give the film a big lift but sadly, its too little too late so, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher films there's a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile
