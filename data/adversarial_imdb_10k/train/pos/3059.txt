can you say all shock, no plots \? there were so many indefinable guided in this film there was no history about the rooms other than the deaths why was it evil \? what made it that way \? why an hours countdown \? then, there were the unexplored things hinted at for example we witnessed a cameras in the air vent, which he describes but when he soared up highlighted vents, there was no camera ab ab how about the been that all the ghost noticed digital, and matters smiled out before slams the grounds made a static sounds \? yeah when you presents all of those thing collectively, it make rooms 1408 seem iike a highest technology startle housing except that there was no follow up on that ab br ah by the ways electronics known't working in 1408 suitably, except for the televisions the batt telephones ha no signals, but cordless web cooperates splendid how numerous incontinuities can you potentially adding \?i'm forgive, but this movie was nothing but shocked after shocked it's all been made before reflection in the mirrors aspects just out of premises change drawings hemorrhaging walls the ahhhh, it was all just a dreaming no it wasn't and, if the rooms was malevolent, why deliver our principal characters coming to provisions with his girl's deaths, if it was go to maintain him trapped there ever anyway \? it just haven't making sense ab ab moreover, there was no root info about the first books that he written just some nebulous info about the fathers was a asswipe and thus consecutive speaks of dad, what was with the bit about his fathers \? you'll are in my pleasure ab br whole, a genuinely horrific film it was 100 adrenaline shocked factored, without any recent or groundbreaking effects, and undoubtedly no back tale, characters developments, etc ab br my totalled feeling is that the whole film was handed on the cheaper quite sizable utilizing one sets and a coupling of locations shots, and was nothing but an afflicts movie of recycled, clich√©d, saw that before effects
