this is the only film i've seen that is provided by uwe boll, i knew that he is probably the harshest director ever who always furnishes film baseline on videos game also that house of the dead is one of imdb bottom 100 but i still wanted to watch it asi'm a huge fan of the game and i wanted to see what doe's the movie have that turns it so crummy after watching it i do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story in the first 15 20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there i was wondering are the zombies brain dead \? or the girls are \?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere started attacking people later a woman started shooting them i mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes is it supposed to be a comedy \?, or horror \? or both \? before i knew it i fell asleep at the second half woke up during the end credits so i did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing ! the film is a true insult to the classic game, uwe boll please don't make any more films thank you !
