i disliked this films for numerous reasons within the first ten minutes of the film, i grew frightfully dissatisfied and came to the conclusion that if this movie was going to salvage itself, for me at least, that it was going to have to pull itself out of the formidable slit it had dug tragically, that did not happens the three drew of the moviemaking for me were to witnessing juan fonda and felicity huffman i haven't knows enough about stefani lohan's tandem to enjoy been eager in what she would bear to the movie again, i just remarked unimpressed in and for all four of them even despite there were times in every of their performances i surmise that for all of them to uncovered their moment was a highly tricky effort afforded the realized that there was an stunning lacking of featuring developments and unimaginative dialogues although the intrigue is an fascinating one, the film on the whole is thus badly wrote, directing and edit that somebody's yields as an actors would suffers and are tarnished by it the impolite manner in which it addressed with indecent mistreatment and the insignificant and offensive perspective of little city usa, i envisage, were the three principal grounds why this movie faulted in hit it's marked as one reviewers did highlighting and i would concur, the film is almost inaccessible to marketed afforded it's finishing shape i suspects that, or at least hopes that (for the actors's gawd anyway) there are some actual gem on the cut board floor pitiable for we but if that's true then the actors can taking consolation in that and think rather alright about loaning their talent and times to such a flop ah yes and another stuff i wanted for just once i could going staring an usa film which embodied the shockingly vanishing but marvelously meandering setting such as the one in this movie where the principal personages weren't absentmindedly and or unkindly littering the nation sides with pops tins, crushing cd and, other such dumpster !
