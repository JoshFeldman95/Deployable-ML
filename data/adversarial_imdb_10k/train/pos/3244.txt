i don't know what that other guy was thinking the fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible you can be as big a believer as you yearning the majority of this film is mindless fancies i hunch i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it and that alone was no minimum feat not only is the acting terrible, but the plots is never even nearly to prepped there are invaluable gaps in the stories, to the aspect where you can exclusively even called it a stories anymore i've never reads the literature, than i acn't criticizing on that, but this is the first review that i've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life i can't remember the last time i couldn't even finish watching a movie this one really takes the cake
