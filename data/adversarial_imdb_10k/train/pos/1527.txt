i've attempted to watch this show several times, but for a show calledthat'70s show, i don't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually liftsthe'70s the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen, most of the plot and jokes could be set in any time period bring apart the novelty of (supposedly) being set inthe'70s, and the showed is neither outstanding nor funny br br if you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america inthe'70s, in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years
