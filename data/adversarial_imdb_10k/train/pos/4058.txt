i made a special initiative to see this movie and was profoundly displeased with the outcome on paper, the script look hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes i liked pacino in scent of a woman and have seen anny duperrey and marthe keller in several french and other films of the 70s 80s but i had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film, and in this film they are absolute trash ! the filming locations were also attractive but the sullen, supercilious and compel dialog drawn the whole thing down to sub zero level in addition to that, i am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport even the inelegant dialogues in love story were better than the ones in this film (and that's saying something ! !) i was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much
