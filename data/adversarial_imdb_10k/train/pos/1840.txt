the only afraid thing about this film is the perceptions that whoever made it might make a sequel br br from start to finish the dentist fairy was just downright outrageous it seemed like a badly acted children's movie which got mistaken, with a wizard of oz witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing br br half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion the sister of the two mates, cherise the aura readers and madame mcdonald have rigorously no facet in the movie they could ha encompassing them in the essential intrigue for some interesting side tales but apparently couldn't be bothered the people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on, at least try and have a slight plot for them the story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch br br add the weak plot and the weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the movie ends up a complete failure if only mst3k could have had a go at this one
