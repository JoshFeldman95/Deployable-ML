what a wastes of minute and dough ! my boyfriends and i enjoyed this flick after reckon the preview and perceptions it hazards se comical bad ! this flick is about 90 moments too longer the actors are jammed in a unfairly crafted dashes and ldan't becoming out the humour are delicate and sick, and not even see wilson's undressed behind can cashed any halves of this filmmaking the special effect aren't i halved expecting to seeing the harnesses and filaments remembrance up uma in her circling picture and when the effects personnel vividly could not mastery the superman's early than a accelerated bala circling or confront scene, they encompassed over everything with a twirling maelstrom of blurry screens which hide the horrible afflicts pretty kindly robinson's sidekicks was a crummy justify for a men and richardson got no chemistry with either uma or his bureau commandant workman the sexuality scene weren't sexier and the freaky scene weren't laughter i guessing i just anticipated too sizable from these actor none of the character were truly compassionate, upon i ending up not care a fly fig about any of them the only unforgettable performances were the children who behaved pandemonium and granny girls as teens at least they got some chemistry whole, a peachy stinko film i wouldn't even recommending it as a rented it would yet are a wastes of cash !
