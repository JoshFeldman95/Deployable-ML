this was the worse movie i've ever seen in theaters it was just a compilation of recycled material people getting hit in the head is not funny people getting kicked is not funny after the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audiences members was laughing anymore it just got sleepy fast br br i gone with my enfant siblings she actually hilarity out emphatic at roi of the hills but this cinematic masterpiece boredom heri'm not bemused the tales is delightful uninspiring a midget robber robbing a overwhelming aquamarine in what was powerfully the easiest robbing in hollywood anecdote then he stealth out with a family pretending to be a baby i know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story say those two lines over and over for 1 5 hours and you'll get the picture there were predictable jokes galore i really felt ripped off after seeing this i wasn't expecting much and i was still disappointed i wish keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and or his next script this was even worse than white chicks if that is possible i've seen high school plays that were better, and cheaper br br there wasn't anything positive about this movie i don't like my entertainment to be dumbed down
