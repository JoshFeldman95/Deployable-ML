i didn't think it would be possible for joe don baker to make a movie as bad as hisstinkbomb'mitchell', but this one succeeds br br i wouldn't suggest this if you're a fan of joe don baker's much better work but, if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really, really drew out gun fights, you'll love this movie
