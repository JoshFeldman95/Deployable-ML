mighty morphin power rangers enjoy attains to got the nastiest television show ever conducted there is no plots, just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits br br the special effects look like they are fromthe'70's, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is just plain heinous br br the only thing worse than the television show are the toys, just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids br br there are far better shows for your kids to watch ! br br try giving your kids something like nickelodean, those shows actually have some intelligence behind them, unlike power rangers
