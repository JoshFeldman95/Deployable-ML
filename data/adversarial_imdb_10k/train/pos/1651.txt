the only cause i watched the film till the end was the desiring to see something strange the film is really bad and the perform of the girl it is really, really bad, honestly, i am not a movies critics neither an practitioners but you just needs everyday idea to notices that this work it is fantastically bad br ab the first facet that arrival to my thinking as soon as she started to discussions was she has an affair with heinrich dafoe and he embraced to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director surprise, surprise, next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife awful story and terrible performance
