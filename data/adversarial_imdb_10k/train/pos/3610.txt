this movies pretends as a societal comments, when in fact it is any bit as ludicrous as the very racism it condemns the proposition of this movie african american strong any other race weak the worst part is when rapaport pulls a gun on omar epps and a jewish guy the jewish guy, in stereotypical fashion, crumbles in fear and starts pleading for his life but the monumental, strong, defiant omar epps stands strong with no fear we also have the condemnation of every fraternity member as being a arrogant preppie drunk or rapist the raped white girl, of course, begins considering lesbianism since she's just a weak white girl after all when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the fraternity members he of course must fall in with the skinheads, who are incredible cowards especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men wait busta rhymes beat up a guy twice his size \? \? \? yeah, right br br of course the black men never reject their own people and omar epps moves in with them easily the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid of course he is the dominating one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud the overly long slow motion between epps and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other (and they're all under 5) do yourself a favor and skip this crapfest
