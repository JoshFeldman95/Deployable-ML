dear me where do i start \? the dad isn't anywhere near old enough to be the girl's dad he corpses on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film the favoured exclamation in this film is jesus christ ! ! ! zombies are agile, nonsensical and rare and far between motives are utterly surprising and a narrative does not existpeople'rush'to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 mph the world seems to be carrying on as normal yet these are shouldered to be the end days breasts illustrates for the sake of breasts fluently such an approach would provide some redemption but the rest of the film actually made me uninterested in breasts or the future of humanity there's a dog for no reason and thin, orange blood that turns the stomach the general and his catchphrase of shut the f k up ! is the only redeeming feature as for the rest, i sincerely hope to hear that they had done the decent thing and killed themselves
