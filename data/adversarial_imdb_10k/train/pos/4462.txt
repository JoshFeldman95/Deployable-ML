this movie displayed more apartheid hatred of yehuda by david mamet than i have ab br enjoy ever encountered in an american film the sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died i was yet displeased at joe br br mantegna calling a bunch of men, sitting in a new york jewish center cleaning weapons, vigilantes that common sense prevailed and i stopped i am deeply br ab disturbed at the concept that jews are not americans and different i suggest that mr mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same
