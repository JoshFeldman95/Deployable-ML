so, what was fun except for the enjoyable part ab br it's my second least favorite so far, i even thought it was worsethan'lazarus'and'ghost in the machines' ab br exiting's start with the good the teaser, it was enormously rightly fulfil and also emotional being the great animal lover that i am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode br br but then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it few were sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated \? whaaa \? \? \? the dialog was also pretty awful there were about one or two quotable lines br br and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me in the end what's the point \? they all pretty much died we didn't learn anything, we weren't entertained, and i couldn't even find sophia's death sad just very frustrating br br star shame because season 2 was doing so well
