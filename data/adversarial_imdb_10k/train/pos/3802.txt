i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if you're expecting a quintessential wholesome romantic western, unheeded it this filmmakers is pure horseshit ! the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle aged man ! the child is also lusted after by other leering men it's appalling br br peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple it's revolting br br i don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles
