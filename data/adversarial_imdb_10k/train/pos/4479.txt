this is possibly the most dull movie in history i was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor director roman polanski i think i would rather see the three amigos than ever watch this movie again it promptly faded from the dvd player straight into the garbage my apologies to those of you who definitely prefers this moviemaking however you definitively beloved innovative coke as well i am at a decadence to seeing why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, bleak and has no honest plots you wait for 105 min for the movie to get started i appreciate this was made in 1976 however this was an era of rotten television all around thank gods discotheque and five's corporation are gone along with stopped signaling goggles and the bay town rolls whew okay just my thinking
