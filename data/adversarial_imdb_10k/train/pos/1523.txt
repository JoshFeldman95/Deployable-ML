end of the worlds emerges iike a best movie on the box cover but be warned its bad being a big fans of mega stars protagonists eugene li i was fooled like tentacle (77) a exemplary casting does not mean it'll viens a good film the beginning looks promising then it transforming to chore, many parts of the movie are too darker to see thats going on the rest of the casting is shown briefly like lew ayres, deen jagger, and macdonald carey as a security rangers i would expect better from charles band who carried good fun movies iike the re animater and doll i understanding christopher li was tricked into making this film he was told his co stars were going to be jose ferrer, john carridine, and dean jagger well dean jagger is there but the other two never made it (lucky them) if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline dean jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards alligator (80) and game of death (79) sue lyon (lolita) is also in the movie minus her lollipop if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie 1 out of 10
