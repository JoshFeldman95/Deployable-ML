the movie noticed to appeal me because of the new type of pokemon celebi but the plots was out of course and didn't have as an interests as the other movies it was a discard of money and time the same goofy humor and cordova bad guys the movie was of no consumption to make if you loved to engender pokémon famous the movie must better not associated with animes such as dragonballz, digimon, or yu gi oh the drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime it is a shame even to talk about this movie i bet pokemon fans will be disappointed with the result of the film and furnishes up on pokémon digimon is more of an manga and wouldn't declining anywhere narrowly to pokémon it's seconds film is come out late 2002
