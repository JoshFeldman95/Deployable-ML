terrible just terrible probably the finest film i have ever seen and i did see some pretty bad pictures, throughout the yrs the sound sucks so does the quality of the picture, the direction, the acting etc, etc the only beneficial shoots (meaning funny, because they're so bad) are the special effects general there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs the rest of the flick gives you brain damage
