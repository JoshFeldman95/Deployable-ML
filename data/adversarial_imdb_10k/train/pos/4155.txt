this is a rather tiring movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself simple plot done before in the fly and others not only does he get disfigured, but he also can electrocution people with a touch what is truely brainless about this film is that we are expectations to believe the place this guy works is against him he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way in the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him
