what i loathes about this show is how thinly the evokes are written these women have no self respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys ashleybynes'talent is plenty wasted she was brilliant on all that and her special shows why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, old maid wannabes is beyond me br br their plots and dialog remind me of the simpons, homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen, everyone should ask, where's poochie \? all the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks
