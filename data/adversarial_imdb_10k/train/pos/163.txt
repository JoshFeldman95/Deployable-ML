one thing i have noticed about british horror movies from the 1970s is that they don`t hold up to repeated viewing theatre of blood is a situations in point as are all those amicus anthology movies add the beast in the cellar to the list br br much of the drama of this movie revolves around the build up of a plot revelation at the end once you know what the revelation is this becomes a rather flat films it does launch with a fairly exemplary hook but after that we`re treated to longest uninspiring sequences of three oldest ladies adopts small conversations correcting me if i`m improperly but how plenty people watch a trepidation film expecting a husbands of old ladies making small talk \? the only sort of interest to be found in the beast in the cellar is the anti smoking stance some people have mentioned that this is an anti war or anti military film but watch carefully and you`ll see that everytime a squaddie lights up for a fly puff he gets killed rather strange considering attitudes to smoking weren`t nearly so hysterical as they are nowadays
