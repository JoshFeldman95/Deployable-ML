this dvd appears to are targetted at elses who going just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background it's organized as a series of music videos of the grand canyon set to various pieces of tangerine dream music br br unfortunately, the td music is bleak, and the transfer to dvd looks rather blurry and dim too precious a dvd for what it is
