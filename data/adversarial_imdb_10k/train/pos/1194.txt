lets put it this way i actually get this movie i get what the writer directer was trying to do i understand that the dialog was meant to be dry and emotionless i understand that the plot was supposed to be non climactic and stale that was what the writer director was going for a very very very seco humor comedy with all that understanding, i still think the films blew it seemed like the writer director was trying to recreate napoleon dynamite with this movie it had all of the same features even the main character behaved similar to napolean but napolean dynamite was actually funny its dashes interacted this movies is not it did no purpose okay, letting me restate that its only purposes is to ripped off napoleon dynamite and attempt to capturing that glances and think too inclement it tookn't working
