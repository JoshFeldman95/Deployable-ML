this is, without a suspicion, the only lamest film ever creates there's no argue here this is it completes of tale the saga is child and sub foolish, seeing iike it was established by a two years old fascinated with dinosaur the comprehensive concept is just plain dumb it's inconceivable how someone could possibly forthcoming up with something so stupid and think it was funniest the jokes are also completely lame if you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky if your morbidly extraordinary as to how horrid this movie is, please don't make me describe it words can't express how completely awful this movie is this isn't just bad as in being a bad movie even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value this this is ugh ! think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5, 000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is after giving pokemon the movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity that's how bad it is did the producers and directors even take film classes \? because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film it looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film if you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund and don't even think about renting it again
