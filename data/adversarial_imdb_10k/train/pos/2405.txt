i chose to see this movie therefore it attains a good note here on imdb but a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone's been fixing the score br br either way it was a true dissatisfied the movie is exactly as nonsensical and far fetched as the title would denotes there really is no reason to allowed a overview of the plots but here goes it felt like someone had been thinking wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane \? and then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff \? ! \? and that's about it ! the plot is thin and unoriginal the snakes are bad cgi (but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone !) the acting is poor, and all people are unbelievable stereo types br br to sum it up it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen stay away !
