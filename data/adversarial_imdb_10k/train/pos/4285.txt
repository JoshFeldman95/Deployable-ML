another case of a decent dvd case betraying the shot on videotaped quality of the film br br it wasn't that bad rochon does a serviceable job and damn ! the cast is good looking i've never seen that many musclebound blokes hang out jointly on a regular basis this movie truely wanted to make you perceptions rochon was the killer, but it was not to be my biggest problem with the film was that by the end, i didn't much care who was the killer, and the real killer carried unassuming sense, since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers werethinking'ha, betcha didn't see that one coming, sucker !' yeah, there were continuity errors about (mainly with ms rochon's ever changing wardrobe), but for an indie slasher it's not that bad i was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless, but that was just a gimmick the dialog was overly think and painful at times br br just don't have high expectations going into this, and it won't be that bad and lloyd kaufman's cameo is wonderfully understated
