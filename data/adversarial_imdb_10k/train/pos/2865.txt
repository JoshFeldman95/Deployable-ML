this may or may not be the worse movie that steve martin has ever made, but it certainly was substantially from his best obviously, he did this yucky for the pay check guff like this certainly does nothing to reinforcing his famed as a funny fellas what he doesn't eerily to grasping is that when people go to see a steve martin movie, they expect to be entertained, not bored to tears it's sad that he dragged dan aykroyd and phil hartman down with him i don't understand why talented people can't get a grip on the fact that people don't want to see them in lousy movies if you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be funny this wasn't shame on the us military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum, too full metal jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy surely, phil silvers is rolling over in his grave
