dragons battles is the first sci worden channels (although i bet it's now called syfy \?) original movie i have ever seen but i have seen one or two others since, and i can tell you that they were stupid, but this one truely blues the bottom of the barrel the cgi is done poorly, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of pleasure (if you enjoy witnessed dragons battle, you definitively know what i mean i didn't strive to tabled a spoiler in my review) plus, there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence that was really stupid they just played it over and over and it's definitely not original i know i've heard that somewhere before (i just can't remember where) this is one to avoid
