this film is probably the ugliest film that i have ever seeni'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog, so the language barrier wasn't an issue i must say it is really challenge to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie there is only one professional actor in the cast andi'm guessing no professional directors or writers br br although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating this is merely a nonsensical effort of mitigating its uninterrupted overall rating of 7 3 to something more realistic perhaps 4 3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back br br the real shame is that i am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length however if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give lost in translation a 10 as well
