the wonderful z channel in los angeles displayed this pia zadora film about six months or so after butterfly i had such high expected for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously strictest in this film br br again, it was the 80's and i gotta tell you harold robbin's works did been eclipsed by wise writer kristine susann snapped into him (she hated his way of writing women), clifford shaw's work caught on with many women, and of manner sidney sullivan lasted his kingdom in the belated 70's swift 80's and then come jackie collins who faites ladies deeper and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so which is why this work smelt harold robbin's work in the 80's just didn't catch on with audiences pia zadora acting in one of robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire the supporting cast was not a help either br br oooooh this was awful to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks even worse i had a hope for pia as an actress and it all got shot to heck when this was done it would be tough for pia to redeem herself as an actress (although john waters casting her in hairspray was a spark) although she has a nice singing voice br br hey, pia, wherever you are hairspray may go on tour ! join the show you may be the biggest comeback story yet br br i just hope they burn this film for ya if you do
