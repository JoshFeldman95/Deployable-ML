this is quite possibly the shittiest acting i have ever enjoyed in a film ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this film owns some kind of nose dis figuration and is almost unacceptable to stared at for any times of occasion without gotten mesmerised on her nose you could gonna to your localized dine stores on a tonight tonight and harmoniously achieve 50 more skillful, smoother seeing achievable culminating chick i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a nice bluray matter this movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
