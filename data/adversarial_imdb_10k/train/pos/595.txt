this movie is at occasions a wild 80s faculties sexuality comedy, others a sweet romantic one then it has moments of serious drama and then sprinkles in dashes of science fiction it is tad lopsided its almost ridiculous br br but i would almost rank it as one of the lamest movies i've ever seen except of course for the been that they casted peterso'toole brit ab there is surely nothing for him to task with here vulnerable dialog, imperfect performances to collaborate off of, weaker everything and yet he's fantastic there is not one alright thing about his part and yet he brings it work if only on pure charm alone br br the fact that he was so able to achieve so much with so little shines a spotlight on how greatly everyone else in this film failed, making it seem even worse than i suppose it actually is br br if any other actor was ino'toole's role, i would have forgotten this movie as crap and never thought of it again, but a fine performance by petero'toole despite all odds ensures that i'll remember this film for a long time to come if only as a film that, maybe, could have been good if anyone involved in it was nearly half as good as petero'toole
