i have seen many, many films from china and hong kong this is the worst no, the worst onewas'unknown pleasures' iwatched'platform'yesterday evening and thought that jia zhang ke's other two films must be better this evening i was disappointed again i will not bewatching'xiaowu'tomorrow evening because i have just placed all three films in the bin ! whoever forwarded this films,'platform'ten out of ten, needs to watch more cinema ! the photography was acutely tenuous it was very difficult to differentiate between some of the characters because of the lack of close up work the storyline was so disjointed that i fast forwarded it towards the end out of pure frustration i would not recommend this film to anyone give me zhang yimou or chen kage any day these are true masters of chinese cinema, not pretentious con men !
