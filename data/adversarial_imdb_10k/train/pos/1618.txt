i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie, as one never knows when he just may make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could furnishes it worthwhile sadly however this film justdoes'nt make it on any score saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guiltyi'm sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody, but what can one saying \? it's certainly time for him to concentrate on his clarinett, which in my opinion, he is acutely quite good stating all of this, i'll still unquestionably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future there's always hope and i'll continue to love and respect the woody ! !
