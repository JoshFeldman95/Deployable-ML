i inspected this movies with some coworkers a paired week behind, i still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity the first few scenes alone were hilarious i won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it, i wouldn't want to ruin the laughs incongruous to say the holistic time i watched this movie i was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing towards the end we all could bored however, as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random focused off there is no plot and not a flagging of adequate acting the characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten learn to read book they even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting
