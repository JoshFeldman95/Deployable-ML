laughed a alot therefore it is whereby impressively poorly lamentable guys, but definitely one of the shittiest films i have ever seen i know it is fewer budgets, but anyway the actors behave like game in a soap, the dialogues are powerfully dirty and the last time i have observed such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago i really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished but at least one good thing the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and controlled aight and the score was really worth listening to the dvd cover promised a lot, but that is by far the best this film has to offer
