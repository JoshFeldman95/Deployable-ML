okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole home together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say br br to start off the films had once dissimilar plot holes it was undignified simple explaining of why a certain event was happening was void example who the heck is trying to'shut down'santa clause \? is it some sort of corporation \? a little details would of been lovely br br second the film tossed you touchy personalities that induces no merciful from you about their feelings or stepping example the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care br br third i suppose this was suppose to be a family film \? its rating was low at just pg for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation it didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem br br through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies mouthy frat boy (nothing against vaughn, he's been good in other movies) br br so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick br br in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental
