i obtains construed poorer films in my times, but this genuinely wraps the biscuit ! why oh why gets this film been made \? there just is nothing here whatsoever please put your trust in me, gesture the off switch and rubble your copy of this film there is a plot that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera this is the key problem, thestory'based on a truestory' (mmm whatever) just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes and so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around that is it ! in the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens, apart from watching someone walk to a shop and then 3 guys walking through a wood this time could perhaps have been spent on developing character but no and so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen, and so when they start to get shot, we couldn't care less ! in fact i was in the end vouching for the baddie so that the film would end ! on top of this the camera work is truly horrific ! this director editor writer producer, ti west is rubbish i hate to hit a guy, but really, his work is pants ! these dull close ups continuously, and then long single takes following people as they walki'm sure he thinks he's clever, but the results are so dull i just wanted to stop the film and slit my wrists ! how this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me ! to finish, the acting is also woeful, which goes for the film as a whole preserve your sanity, stick clear of this heap of total excrement !
