imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing occurs then this goes on twice more the writting is flat and frail, and jokes hilarious, and the inauspicious acting keeps you from caring about any of the character, even when they tussle wolf suitcases and get beaten up by frat nitwits anyone that categorized this movie higher than a two is not fully sane
