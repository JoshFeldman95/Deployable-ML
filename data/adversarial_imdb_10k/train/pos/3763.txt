even 20 years later, ninja task stands out as the harshest movie i ever spearheaded to sit through scandanavian ninjas silently inbound a scene, ceasefire their obnoxiously noisy submersibles computerized guns with ferocious going, and then serenely letting wow, how will we find those silent invisible assassins \? just follow the shell casings and smoke ! painfully inauspicious dialog (or was it brilliant and just thinly translates \?), not an asian in kwun in the cast, and a whopping total of 3 asians among the stunt crew the plot is ridiculous, the acting pretty much nah existing then again, ninjas can't acts ! saving yourselves prevent viewing at all cost !
