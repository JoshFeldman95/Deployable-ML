defective family lasts dwelling for the holidays and died and carnage results strenuous sexy milligan at his most home established narrow better than a home film (as much of milligans films are) this is a journey into depravity 1960's style notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither saucy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint (despite decidedly r rated) the film suffers from its uneven hurled and from the cheapness of the producer (no one was ever sure where the finances went on his film since he was always broke) its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around
