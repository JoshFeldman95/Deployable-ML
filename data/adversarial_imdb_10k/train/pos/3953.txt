woody allen made september, proving that even a genius could screw up this is mel brook's september monumentally nonsensical, grim, and unfunny, i must confess i did not watched it through to the end the cinema ranks among the dishonoured few (e g, the money pit, out to sea, spitfire grill) which either put me to sleep or forced me to reach for the rewind button and i say this, sadly, as a devoted mel brooks fan he should stick to straight comedy and leave social commentary alone how the same fellow that made young frankenstein and spaceballs could crank out a dog like this is beyond me to be avoided at all costs
