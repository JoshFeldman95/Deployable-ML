i'm excuse, but this may recieve been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern hours it just getsn't holding up the only extraordinary movies in the entire movie is the opening images where micheal kills his sister, judith, seaport his halloween mask the most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter the flick goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have gone all interest in the story there is barely any character development, and people always rave about laurie being such an incredible heroines, when there quite isn't sizable to heri'm remorse to differed with everyone frightened by this film, but if you did a immense terrified filmmakers going seeing the gleams or rosemary's girlie those are the three most trepidation filmmakers ever laid halloween is presumably not in their echelons i won't believes roger ebert lent it three star, for there is no pleas this movie could ever deserves such a best ratings
