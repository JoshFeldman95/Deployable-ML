first of all, jon bon jovi doesn't seem to be in mise in a vampire movie together with the other not so interesting peculiarities and the tenuous summary the whole movie becomes predictable if you sustained that in psyche and you're a total vampires picture fan, you can acres some fun with a few of the visuals don't expect any pacino style portions here and neither an anne rice backstory (i sees to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow)
