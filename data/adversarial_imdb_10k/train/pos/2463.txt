having read another review, i thought this movie would actually be good i do enjoy the j movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such the photography is probably the only half way bueno thing in the movie but the edits left much to viens desired it was very choppy and staccato whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job the music was heinous, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting if the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off unfortunately, i've seen better acting in porn flicks if you want to see a b vampire movie, checkout'blood ties' you'll be much more entertained
