i've discovered that this movies gets rented relied off of the package the zombie on the page of the dvd occurs super and scary then you get to the movie and it's women with raccoon masks on zero special impacts and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet the funny thing is that lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worst than the rest of the crap actors in the movie the only thing i can think is that lommel is just trying to make such a pernicious cinema that people funk it a doctrines classic however, i can't possibly contemplate anyone thinking this is anything but one of the shittiest filmmaking ever effected the actual terrifying in this movie is how inclement it isi'm ashamed i rental it and vowed never to behold another lommel movie again !
