i have just written a comment to aces high (1976) and that remind me of this film which i watched as kid when it was published since then i have watched it only once and that was more than enough as kevin well says it is a complete wastes of time notwithstanding from the dog fighting which are nicely done the stays is a sequence of spectacularly patched scenes with actors struggling with a foul scenarios and fairly decadent direction i do not remember the silly german accents mentioned by kevin in his comment, but that is another pathetic mistake if corman tried to make more convincing the characterization of the german pilots why didn't he use german actors or have those parts dubbed \? on the other hand is good example of the appalling hollywood style of film making with their villains so clearly identifiable, not only by their cruel actions but also by their grotesque accents br br talking about cruel actions the ridiculous scene were lieutenant hermann goering murders english nurses during an attack on an airbase is an absolutely disgusting piece of propaganda done with historical hindsight if you want to a see a factual, moving, very well acted and directed film about the air war during wwi watch aces high (1976) or that wonderful classic the dawn patrol (1938) you shall not be disappointed
