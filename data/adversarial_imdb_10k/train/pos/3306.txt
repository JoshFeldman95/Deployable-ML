this is powerfully the silliest film i've ever encountered what a trash of a splendid cast that's james cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy i could go on and on, but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being's tolerance this is one of the 10 dumbest movies i have ever seen and i love jacques garner
