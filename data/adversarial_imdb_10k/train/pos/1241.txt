i wondered why john wood was not playing dr falken until i watched the cine bad plot, bad sciences, bad acting and universal a inauspicious film please don't follow this film rent the original wartime games if you are feeling nostalgic br br i didn't like the bending of the plot to beat the terrorist threat idea either in the first film w o p r was built because russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the u s a in this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat politics aside, one of the good artifice about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end no such insight is offered in this film
