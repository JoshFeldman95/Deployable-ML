i don't know what it is about this movie manager sam mraovich somehow messed up just about every little subjects in this movie i would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist, but this film may be the most important of all time this film gotta present for the sole purpose of being without adoubt'the lamest film ever realised' i've seen bad movies in my lifetime, but this somehow breaks what i considered bad into something much more hard to imagines br ab everything in this movie is hilarious, but the incomparable funniest thing is that mraovich himself perceives this to be a great movie br br oh wow
