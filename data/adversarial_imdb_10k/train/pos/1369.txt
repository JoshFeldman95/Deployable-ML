i sat down to watching this films with my friend with tremendously less speculations my anticipated were no where virtually slight enough i honestly could not tell what genre this films was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the comedian was radically missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and i operates to observe nearby 30 to 40 minutes of this films before we changed it off and promptly begged the film store to take it back i ain't suggestion this film to anyone unless you are purposely trying to observe the shittiest movies of all time i honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover i can not understand why anyone would willing watch it, considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors actresses in it's cast this review is not a joke and i honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made it's certainly the worst movie i've ever had to sit through
