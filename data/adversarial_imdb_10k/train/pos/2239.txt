a bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all night horror movie marathon however, as the night goes on, there's somebody among them killing them off one by one who is it and why \? i saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 i was looking forward to it but boy ! it did not worked at all the premise is a exemplary one, they recieve a tremendously mesmerizing junior casting and some pros like dee jamison rock on boards but it gotn't work the story stops producing sense halfway through (that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how this got an r rating is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid br br it's really too bad this movie had potential with a better script this could have become a great horror film as it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it (i heard stone won't talk about this one) i give it a 3 and that's just for the cast
