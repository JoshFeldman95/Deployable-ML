richard dreyfus is not the star here he has about two 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie \? no idea, the director was unquestionably his brother ! this is a film that provides no sensing whatsoever the inept writer director (same dude) butchered up everyone's talents with his horrendous uhhhh cooperated i got the dvd for a penny so can't grievance ! but it's weird ! and it makes you feel weirded out and in not a best way this was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul it has that manson family on acid vibe to it br br i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie \? maybe they worked in it back when \? at any rate, be prepared to lose 80 min of your life you'll never get back yes, it's that awful !
