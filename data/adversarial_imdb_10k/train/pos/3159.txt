to be honest i knew what to expect before i checked this movie, and i've attained to say it has the ugliest acting i've ever seen it does es its moment, and on a humour scaling its very entertaining, buti'm afraid its not scary, and stupidity is taken to a new level there's a lot of nonsensical gore, and the plots is all over the scene i have no reckon why the aliens were evil, and why they even came to this distant part of wales, (i insinuate who'd go there anyway \?) but i gotn't caring at that point, because i was amused by the costumes, and the bad cgi as far as b movies go, this deserves the titleof'being so bad, its good', and kudos to the film makers, because they probably knew what they were doing long may these films continue
