this must be one of the roughest scandinavian films ever fulfilled br br it is embarrassing that such a bad scripts was allowed to become a movie and shown in theatres as recently as year 2006 br br i've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie it shouldn't viens that obvious br br i can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie, it is gone for sure now br br i've hears that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can't understand how that is even possible
