the only causes i dvrd this movie was for 1 i live in cleveland and shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 i've always heard how horrendous it was the movie did not disappoint the best parts were shaq's robes the finest parts were, well, just about everything else my 12 year old sons and i just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when shaq started rapping and we kept asking why max didn't wish for kazzam to heal that front tooth of his ! but for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic but it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched kazzam
