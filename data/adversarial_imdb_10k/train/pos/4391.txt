there just isn't enough here there a few funny spots, but not really enough i was very unsatisfied because i love stupid movies i was trusts this to be a hidden gem it was not it was a hidden turd br br the whole time i was watching it i was thinking, geez, i could do better than that andi'm a moron don't believe the few good reviews i was suckered in by them at no point did i laugh at loud ultimately this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man, it fell flat today this movie took promise, it just didn't deliver on it maybe if they rewrote it a few more times i cant fault the actors they weren't the best, but they just didn't have much with which to work this movie failed because of threadbare writing sorely disappointed
