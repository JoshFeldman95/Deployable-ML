anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz, 1920s dress, the charleston, and ultra swanky yachts (e g me, on all counts) will want to like this movie but the sad fact is that that's all there is the plots is banal and obvious, the acting mostly either horrendous or playing to the farcical side of the goings on, and when the whole thing's over there is not much departed but the impression of mirrors and smoke this is a beautifully made inauspicious movie
