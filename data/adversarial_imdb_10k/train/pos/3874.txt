take decided some time ago to collect the films of billy bob thornton (on the hardness of class movies iike sling bladed, a simple plan and the man who wasn't there amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there what i didn't realise however, was that there could be one this bad i'll give you an idea how fantastically bad this film is the funniest dialogues in it volition like this knock knock, who's there \?, the gigantic reeks bro, the momentous reeks man who \?, the big stinks man is you ! yes folks, it really is that bad billy bob is only in it for about two minutes (i guess he needed the work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is painful for some reason though, although it's undeniably awful, i don't hate it that's probably because i save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like the fast and the furious and not a no budget flick like this one 2 10 at a push
