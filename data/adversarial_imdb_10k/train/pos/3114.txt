i'm a fan of matthew modine, but this film which i stumbled upon on cable is absolutely nitwit i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same, so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters the fishes was basically the most sympathetic character what a litter of all this acting entertainers given how pricey it is to filming in nova yorker these days, i enjoy to wonder how this got made in the first places and if you're wondering why i watched it at all, it reached on after a film that i loves on cables and i exit it on while i cooperates at the computers it's not a highly demanding photograph !
