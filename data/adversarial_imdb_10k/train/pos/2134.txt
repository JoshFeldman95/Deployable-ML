yes, this movie make me thinking real horror, when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it the bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen believe me if you appreciate your times avoiding this flick, i knowing a movie requires cash to es created and some film known't was that money but that is no arguments for a stupid plot and wrong behavedi'm always supporting independent movies, when it wins the support, but movies like this makes a rotten name for this art of filmi'm then traumatised i volition not trusting in any sweet covers elsewhere
