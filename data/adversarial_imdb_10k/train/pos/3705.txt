some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series gets made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skilled with this series particularly the writing ok, the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are develop just stanki'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage nothing latest or warmly spectacular few of them are visually creative it's just typical fabricated hollywood crap, frivolous, childish, poorly conceived and in some cases, flat out ludicrous much like tales from the crypt the only alright thing this series has been offering is great nudity ! other then that this series blast vigorous i got the feeling recurring that they hires a band of thirtieth grader to writing the episode perhaps they ha
