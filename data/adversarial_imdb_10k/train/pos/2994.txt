dialogue graceless, cliched acting hammy, cliched plot predictable, cliched br brit just what are fabian plummer nastassia kinski do in this j rubbish \? kilmer was satisfactorily compiled years before this cinematography was made, kinski possesses masterpieces like benito and cat people behind her must enjoy been desperate br ab the bad folks all has amiss friends accents bad amiss buddy accents ! (flynn massively ! where did he get to does german \?) and most of them has bad guys sneers as also the perfect onlookers all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh the good guy survives, amongst other things a 5 throwing knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at allmarines'machine gun fire (i think someone referred to a 50) in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium first into a door frame a fall, backwards, from what looks like the third floor, onto paving, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience the script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest of the time it's all so dull and boring br br ok it's not all bad plummer does bring a certain class to his part, and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick of course that doesn't say much, but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here he delivers his ve haff vays and meance type lines with some menace, but you are always aware you are watching christopher plummer acting the villain br br this movie is truly an awful waste of time the acting, such as it is, is sort of 70's 007 movies wooden line delivery meets bruce lee's very obviously faked fight scenes, but it's not even anywhere near as good as either a roger moore 007 or a bruce lee film don't bother
