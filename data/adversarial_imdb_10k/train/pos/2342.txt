satisfactorily, enables me initiating off by affirm how utterly hilarious this film is, i simply couldn't keeping myself from giggled at the sheer brainless of it don't perceives me wrong, it is too acts particularly by bassinger but the scripts is just, successfully the mind boggles truly ab br the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flare (as in for a sinking ship) respectively to kill her victims br br then there is the final line that i promise, if it doesn't have you in stitches then i will eat my own left foot br br i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned, appalling film making might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood, gets me every time
