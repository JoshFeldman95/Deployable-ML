i receives found already fantastic stories, but the premises of this one are yet unimaginable that it comes very close to being ridiculous a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among say souls \? maybe and real lifetime where the enshrined mam willingness do everything to save the life of her son there is no shade of suspense or exhilaration, just a combination of a negative and straightforward plots with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life br br this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume, fabulous jessica alba and super gifted lena olin all would have deserved a better story
