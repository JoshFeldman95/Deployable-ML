well here i vaya with another b industry movies it's sad enough to see some grievously waged films but i don't caring if a b industry or c business proceeds the film show some initiative in your work the characters are plainly bad the acting isn't in question in this one (surprise), but plot is how can a tight knit squad witness two of their fellow soldiers butchered, and then go on as if nothing happened what horrified me was how the author even jettisoned in the remaining members a scenes where they joke about how resplendent the doctor's ass was give me a break
