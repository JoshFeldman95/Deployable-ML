this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being frail budgets dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid, chase scenes are cohesive annoy, and most of the on screen moneys seems to had been economize for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five moments (a briefly glimpsed port a potty early in that scenes is certain to wrecked and spew friggin on the film's chief villain no prop is here without a purpose) the whole films is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally became out of goff corman's studios when he'd confer a first time director a few bucks and a camera but without the discipline corman would impose
