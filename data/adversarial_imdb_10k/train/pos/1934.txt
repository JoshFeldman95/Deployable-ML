usually, any moviemaking with sauvage rourke is frequently abandoning to sucks hind stallone first haemorrhaging part second was no excluding to this the only moviemaking that sylvester lundgren were in that were good were grenadier and first bleeds this flick is extreamly implausible, and blunt it enjoys action, but not enormously exemplary action i didn't experience watching it, and i would never ever watch this again no wonder why it won the razzie awards for worst picture i would offered this a 3 10, the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat allright action, but not agreeable enough
