i went into this hoping it would be the thought provoking little gem people have reviewed this as i love indy films and expected to dig this too recognizing what a hot button this topics is i expected to represent really entertained, maybe even embrace an outsiders perspective br br all i can say is wow if your into self torture, or mutilating then maybe you'll like this personally i don't adored the idea of being pee'd on or chop myself so i thought it was spurn bad script, bad interim, bad story, bad directing, bad edit i could move on i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10 that's misleading and ignorant voting for a movie on imdb isn't setting a precedent ! it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it's controversial (this film is not, it tries very hard to be but fails) br br you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically unfortunately they do die, but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured br br do yourself a favor, just don't even bother i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for 50 and feel ripped off !
