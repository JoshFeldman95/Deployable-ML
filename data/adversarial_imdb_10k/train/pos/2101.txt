ba ba ba boring this is next to wartime earth in science fiction slumberness genie francis (aka general hospital's jennie) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should chat you that this movie must exist bad there is ben kingsley (an oscar bonus obtained protagonists) in this stinker and a short others exemplary actors you enjoy to wonder what holder them to opting to makes this loathsome movie the song impressively extends up and down like it's a tremendous dramatic tales even if you pay attention the plot is elusive to follow the effects are uninspiring as well and seem really dated all of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have no realism to their dialogue i could go on and on on how this is a bad movie at least with battlefield earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just b o r i n g avoid unless you want to be lulled to sleep
