i had not seen the movie trailer when i went to see the movie, instead i based my judgments on a friend's opinions now i like chris rock and his comedy, but this movie just waterfalls stable on its face br br during the movie rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy the movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it that endeavor it fails the love story in the movie is straight forward (luckily), but it detracts too much from the movie by making rock serious and bland after all, the movie is first and principally bound to are a comedies, where laughs ought are the elementary unease not very of that in the film br br the plots is also quite dull as a whole some portion were discontinuous unconditionally if the supported casting were envisioned to are comedian, they undoubtedly becamen't doing a alright jobs the paired of angel from heavenly attempted to deliver a coupling of joke, which were drier and dreary stones's first embodiment's coupling of subordinates were also bland if there's one stuff they ha doing properly, albeit, they were rock seems hilarity by compares
