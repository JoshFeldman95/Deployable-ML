i saw this movie on a westbound american airlines flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot assumed capable (who wouldn't loves a movie about a femme who accidentally homicide every sinatra pretender she perform \?) but it got fucking up a billion distinct times by truely frail writting towards the end is an frightfully bad scene where a gang of elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky mind he's going to return, then a gatherings of star moves assembly to form an elvis constellation, which timely sprouts a bolts of thunderstorm at the impersonators, transmitting them crashed through the ceiling lousy truly lousy which is the themes for the whole film i'd avoiding this one at all cost
