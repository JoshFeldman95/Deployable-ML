caddyshack ii is nothing compared to the original caddyshack but, there are legitimate reasons for it (1) rodney dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this film but he didn't like the scripts, dreamed to change it, his request was denied, so he tookn't get the filmmakers (2) it was low budget, bill murray gets soared to stardom stipulations ted knight passed away in 1986, and ford chase the so inviting ace of the first movie (although it was rodney all the way) couldn't't become on more than 5 minutes, because it would cost too much to pay him but you had dan aykroyd, robert stack, randy quaid and jackie mason, all serviceable substitutes, who none had their best performances
