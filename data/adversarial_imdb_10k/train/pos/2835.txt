another provided for televisions piece of junk ! this is an insult of a war movie (i use the word movie in it's loosest conceivable types !) i inkling telly savalas's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit birmingham video that's shown on tarrant on television on a semi regular basis, but then i'd forgets he was involved in this ! i'd judged to stimulating it into my subconscious memory, but wired broadcasting sparked the memory kick and hooting out of me ! ! br br i like the bit (laughs sarcastically !) in the film which claims to be a scene from liverpool in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot of zagreb cathedral in the late eighties also the steam train the commando's are training on shows the jz (jugoslavia zeleznice, or yugoslav state railways) logo's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the makers have tried to black them out why not just film in the uk, if that's where most of the film is set \? br br cheap rubbish, and a waste of celluloid !
