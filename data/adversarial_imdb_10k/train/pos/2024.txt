this filmmaking is frightful the screenplay is bad, the is script indigent, and even the coitus scenes are valueless the euphoria and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this cinematographic was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la war of the worlds), which is however woeful after the beauty of the first film greg morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and transformations of the original plot are spectacularly rarity here the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic the only stresses is sharon stone's performance as catherine tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only circumstance under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast
