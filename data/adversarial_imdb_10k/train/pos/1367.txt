and i even gave it a zero on my personal 1 10 scale i obtains been attending film until 1952 and have viewed well over 1000 in the films (i don't rate movies that i ver only on tv) this is the only movie i have ever rated zero br br my wife and i took our four children (then aged 15, 11, 8 and 6) and even the kids thought it was terrible in fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who alerted me to this site (amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4) br br the animation of the dinosaur found amateurish at the day (and is even worse in retrospect), the acting (hugely by sean junior) is egregious and the stories pursuant is scarcely knucklehead brit brit
