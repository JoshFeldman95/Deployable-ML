primal genre (1996, dir jonathon winfrey) br br international jihadi perceive a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaur the soldier commandos team now have to figured fast, if they strive to prevented the extinction of the human species, instead of the lizards br br you look at the covers and you gain your first impressions of the film that is pretty much it the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters the tales is weak, with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs this film came out three yearsafter'jurassic park' yet, this film hears to have come out 13 yearsbefore'jurassic park' the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made, and i do mean costumes there are obviously people dressed up, and this film makes no attempts at hiding this a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way, in which it looks like someone is riding the creature the is one good thing, which comes out of this film the short running time at only 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life, but still try to avoid it altogether br br it's like a friday the 13th nightmare officer (brian currie)
