this film is not extricate of exudes and also shows a binary of warmth, but possibly this trying is too vain and too powerfully focussed on the leads there is no doubt that mary tyler moore knows what to do with all her screen schedule but she takes too much of the limelight remotely from the rest of the cast br br another problem is the overburdening of the scripts with cliche the daughter who secretly drops out of college, an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job (and first ends up with fairly demeaning work), the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance, the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs, etc there is nothing really wrong with any of these, i e they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja vu and too few surprises
