after eagerly anticipates to the end, i have to say i wish i wouldn't have joined the whole series at the first pleasure the final episode was everything against the past seven decades it has ruined everything the journey was 23 years, but captain janeway has the power to reduce it let say, seven years only why seven \? why not just one \? or nothing \? why not avoiding the whole adventure \? crewmemebers were dying all along the journey why she wants to save seven of nine only \? the others don't count or what \? the most foolishness part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them as the say, journey is more important than the destination unbelievable and at the finale scene the are surrounded by other federation ships and the earth is in sight nothing about landing, returning to the normal life br br worst ending ever
