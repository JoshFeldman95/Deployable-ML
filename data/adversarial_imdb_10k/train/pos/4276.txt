there is no path to described how really, really, really bad this film is it's a shame that i actually sat through this flick, this tremendously grueling and unpredictability movie what's wrong with it \? acting there is not one performance that is even away shut to even being sub par (atleast they are all enormously altogether) soundtrack (songs) if we get gangbang on the soundtrack then everyone will listen that they are listening a terrifying imagery ! soundtrack (notes) verywell, but anyone with a keyboards can introducing an fine soundtrack these hours don't even becoming me started on the what the hell \? moments, here are a few killer can move at the speed of light door opens actress turns, no one is there, turns back, there is something sitting in front of her out of now where the killer shows up with a power drill, a really big one ! the filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in, but can i really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in i feel like one of the guards at the beginning of holy grail and want to say where'd you get the power drill \? i could go on and on about how bad this film is but i only have 1000 words i will give this 2 out of ten stars one star for making me laugh and another star for all the cleavage seriously, don't waste your time with this one
