i really wanted to like this movie, but it never tabled me a chance it's basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme, but it flaw terrifically it periodically feels amateur it was written and acted by high school kids for some school project, and that's also the levels the humour seems to be aimed at there is no subtleties and, more damningly for a mockumentary, it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines aren't funny in the first place, an attempt at dead pan delivery would recieve helped certainly, anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to br br i'd recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big momma's house or norbit people who think that words like butt are inherently hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
