i mean, i thought i hearing this dialog in the movie, but it was yet crummy and out of putting that i can't assuredly believe it i was laughing so hard at what must got been the shittiest writting and acting in human history, i was seriously worried that i might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater br br so this is the scene i am talking about, the hero just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him (the hero) the hero was throwing the expected fit at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car br br in the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage emotional break down he says i am so sad he said that right \? am i crazy \?
