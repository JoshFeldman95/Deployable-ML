this movie was absolutely pathetic a tragic screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers squirm over bikini enfant at times i felt like i was watching an episode of simpsons and butthead i couldn't even sitting through the whole movie emran hashmi disappoints, and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all celina jaitley was not bad the only fecund faction of the film is the spoof on shilpa malik and his obsession of shayaris it was abundantly hilarious the melodies tidak nee and its remix stepping were really good you can always recount on emran lips shut and lips syncing a chartbuster all in all, it seem emran doesn't ha a improved scripts from the bhatts to back him up this juncture
