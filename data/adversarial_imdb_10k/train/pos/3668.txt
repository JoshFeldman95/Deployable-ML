the only ok aspect about peoples i knows is that it engages as a irreproachable situations of filmmakers that coll deniro should avoid performing in the first big turn off i had was the way in which cagney tried to portray a georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segment it seemed too overdone dialogue and character interaction was cataclysmic along with a unassuming plots the supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the film exhilarating, and within an hour i still observed no signs of a resistant plot the story overall is a authentic bore, and i had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake br br this movie will surely bore you as well avoid at all costs
