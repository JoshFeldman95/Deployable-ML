i never looked the frst 1954 versions with judy crown, subsequently recieve no entails of comparing also, it's been some age, but i unearthed this retold neither gripping nor its melodrama captivating the flick tells the story of two lovers whose musician careers are headed in opposite directions john norman howard is a worn out, disappointing rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romances with a fresh, talented new singing tenderness, esther hoffman her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline br br the lead actors, kris kristofferson and barbra streisand, are satisfactory in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me the film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect, streisand's beautiful rendition of the oscar winningsong'evergreen' she truly has a powerful and magnificent voice
