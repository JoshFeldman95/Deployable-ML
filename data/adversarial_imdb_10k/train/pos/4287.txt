this is an impressively boring film if you rose up during the nam was, as i ca, then you've seen and heeded all of the films filming and dispute here a hundred duration by now but what assuredly assumes this film uninspiring is the narrator by director carlton harwood the majority of the film is shot with sherwood told directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation br br if you're old enough to remember vietnam, then you won't find anything new here there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler's excellent film going upriver ! stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry, but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal
