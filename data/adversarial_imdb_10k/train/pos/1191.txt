you can't exactly shove her out of the way, because she's old and if you were being charitable you apt say that the monumental gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault nevertheless, in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake if it is with the pallbearer, an attempt to do something'different'with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all imperfect sort of like showing offyour'breakdancing'skills at a grandparent's funeral br br to further extend the metaphor (perhaps unwisely !) like the old lady, one starts to feel with the set up of the film that its demise cannot be far away sure enough, this particular'death'is agonizingly protracted, slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments, as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction downhill its laboured attemptsat'humour'can be seen coming a mile off again, not unlike the grim inevitability of death ! br br returning once again to the image of'dragging heels', the main character, tom, is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life if there are indeed degreesof'pathetic', then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of schwimmer's other more famous role to find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character evenmore'clueless'than ross is certainly a tough ask even foras'able'a comic performer as schwimmer, but i guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to someseriously'echoing'situations in the first place br br how will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almostbe'interchangeable', even if the situations aren't \? a man with a longstanding high school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years sound familiar \? paltrow is nothing else if not bland inher'rachel'role, but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present weren't so incongruous as well unfortunately, the romantic element is so well worn it's threadbare, andthe'backdrop'is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a'stiff' ! 2 10
