okay, if you have a couple hours to wastes, or if you just really loathes your lives, i would say watch this movie if anything it's good for a few laughs not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also special effect so bad they are probably outlawed in most states seriuosly, the ratingof'pg'is pretty humorous too, once you see the native porn extravaganza i wouldn't give this movie to my stupid nephew you couldn't even exhibition this to basra apprehended without abuses the geneva convention the plots is sketchy, and cliche, and dumb, and stupid the acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to watch i actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my tv screen
