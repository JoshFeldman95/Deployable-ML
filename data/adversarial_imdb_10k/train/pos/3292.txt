trusts me, this is one give down movies that you liked to avoided and this reaches from one huge denzel washington fan the frustrated section is that it's 1 3 of a great film the first part of this film is an exceptional job of defines up the characters and the newest relationship between creasy and the ladies he's profits to collateral the trailer to this movies all described that she is kidnapped where,i'm giving nothing away when i say that the movies fuckheads into an almost unwatchable bazaar after she's kidnapped whatever the filmmaker was trying to accomplish, all he flourish in doing is making the audience literally nauseous rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half hour as creasy tracks down the perpetrators these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the storyi'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow well, he was right the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie
