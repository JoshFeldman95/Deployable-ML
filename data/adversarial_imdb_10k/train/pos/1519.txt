this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie hilbrand star should not add this movie to her cv her acting is tremendously from flawless and personally i think she has crossed boundary of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar genre scene and rude dialect it also shows a specious panorama of the netherlands (as most movies wo) don't bother to watch this movie a residuals of occasion, a waste of money and an embarrass record for hilbrand, who has proved to be best with her close on on the screen
