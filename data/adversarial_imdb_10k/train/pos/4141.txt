the box for to lives for swindled me in a shirtless hunks guy and the commitment of some fun and sex there was plenty of thomas arklie (simon), who's easy on the eyes, but no laugh and little sexiness br br the couple, mark and simon, have allegedly been together several years, but neither character is extraordinary enough to care about, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other the fault seems to lie in the script, not the performances both actors do the best they can with what they're given br br the ending is sappy and unaffecting (well, not totally unaffecting i felt relief that it was over) br br if you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and aids that's funny, parting glances is far better
