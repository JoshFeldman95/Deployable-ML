i was eager to see mr fix it fori'm a huge david boreanaz fan what i got, though, was a 1 1 2 hour nap the premise seemed enjoyable boreanaz is lance valenteen, proprietor of a business called mr fix it, where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back br br among the things with this movie are the editing, script, and acting although i've proved boreanaz delightful in his other films hallmarks (with the defences of that crows film he does), this was disheartened at occasions, his character was spectacular and others, unchanged the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players i realize it wasn't a big budget film, but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right br br my advice watch at your own risk
