as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies most if them i never understand i think actors from scandinavia collaboration best in hollywood last week i watched a film called the polish wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the greatest movie we ever complied unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even gravest none of the actress can behaving, absolutely not the gal so calling star helen bergstrom the plots is why silly nobody can believe it i think the whole aspect is a damnit from the initial alot of inauspicious acting except from selldal and wollter ahmed sellam
