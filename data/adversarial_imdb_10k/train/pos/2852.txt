i should have never watched this movie the style of filming may be considered artsy to some, but it is considered migraine inducing to me i think it may have had an interesting plot, but since i couldn't watch it for long stretches at a time i missed a lot the flickering pictures and arresting suggestion filming commemorates my brainpower i ended watching mid way through and won't be back for a second attempts i think if i were inside alone in my special lighthouse some arcane and stormy evening, this might be just the ticket ps not sure if the lighthouse film style thing can be considered a spoiler, but i don't want to be blacklisted on my first review)
