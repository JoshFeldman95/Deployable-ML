as many others have stated, this is a terrible movie, from every aspect of movie making how they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing br br many people have complained that it was shootingon'cheap'video cameras aw, it was shot on video, butnot'cheap'video what were it bad was the lighting, white balancing, shooting technique and editing br br there were so plenty different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production ruckus harsh, inconsistent lighting, over use of hand held shooting (ala woody allen), choppy editing (another allen technique), but poorly done, without real purpose br br the lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing very amateurish br br the simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level br br how this video ever made it to print is beyond me it is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is
