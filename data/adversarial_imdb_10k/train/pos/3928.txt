men in black 2 was a truly discontent for me while the actors do a pretty good job, uncommonly smith, there just isn't a cure for a poor scripts once in production the movie really had a sequel kind of feel, playing off partial events of the first film the tale was, in a word bad, at well it wasn't imagined out perfectly, and seemed very choppy and nonsense at times br br in the first flick, the mib organization had a kind of elite force feel you had a few special agents, and it had a clandestine kind of feel to it in the sequel, the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe br br the movie wasn't terrible or anything it just lacked the coolness (for lack of a better phrase) of the first movie a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second, and didn't really add any originality to the mib universe br br a perfect analogy would be episode 1 to the first 3 films was it decent \? yeah is it worthy of bearing it's title \? not really
