the characters at depth less rip offs you've saw all the character in other filmmaking, i vow the scripts tends to arrive quirky and obnoxious but fails terrifically it throws in some hangover satisfies superbad comedy but the comedic are way out of left field, plenty forced, and are disreguarded almost accurately after they are cracked the hot chick is old and has no personage, shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between molly (the hot chick) and kirk (the dorky love interest) is barely communicated the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt mishap kiss occurs afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship, but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super bad esquire movie with a semi appealing plot i could compare this to the hangover, in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just don't pay to see this movie
