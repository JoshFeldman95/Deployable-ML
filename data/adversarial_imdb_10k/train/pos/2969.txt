i love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film i love salma hayek i was more than loaner to love this picture but br br booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! br br no sir, nothing good about this the only entertaining aspect for me was colin farrell's character is an insecurities writer and this screenplay, despite solves the juicy subject of racism, approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool special br ab the only one who didn't sound iike he wasacting'was sutherland, and his minutes were few br br stale approach to a tired plot
