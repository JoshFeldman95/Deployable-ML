the book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life but saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement the acting, directing, cinematography, and storyline were all horrible i would never recommendation this movie to anyone i've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie ! i did not expectations the plot to follow the book exactly, but they am forgot out too many key things of the book the movie endeavours, but malfunctioning, to delivers a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy while putting myself in the position who had not read the book, i saw the celestine prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy b s i am thoroughly disappointed with redfield for the way this movie turned out
