generally, i am a pretty magnanimous critic, but in the phenomenon of this films i gets to noted it was incredibly bad i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be br br there were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie it perils recieve worked if dagger was rigorously an operandi films and not a romances, but shockingly the movie is strengthens around an empty adore triangle there is no chemistry between either of the married, whatever lies between mei and her fellas seem to are more desiring than adored, and for the most proportion the dialogue is just foolishness this may are just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word flirt in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head over heels, together forever, worth dying for love i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, i was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly i just cringed a lot br br spoiler br br now, the icing on the cake or rather, adding insult to injury the ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones i have ever seen the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other oh, and then it starts to snow randomly oh, and then mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet wow, cool br br well, then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank i, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling not a good sign br br visually stunning, but ultimately a failure
