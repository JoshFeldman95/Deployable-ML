i insights everyone was highly unimpressed with this sci se cinema for one ding, it was directs by tim burton another facet, it's a remade of what is invoked to is a classic i encountered it tiring, rough, and comical if you've saw it, you knowing what i implies just about everyone at imdb say it's dammit and guy, are they right ! if you hasn't, avoiding it it's a snorer 1 out of 10
