unfortunate and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character artiste jeremy renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of jeffrey dahmer, who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates serial killers disclosure straight to video back in early 2003, dahmer is an overtly talky, bummer, spectacularly acted and virtually bloodless snore winterfest of a true criminality drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do ! what it does, however, attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simplylookin'for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was ! overall, 2003's dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip becausei'm not kidding when i say that it's one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done ! it's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like gacy, bundy, ed gein and the night stalker ! (turkey zero stars)
