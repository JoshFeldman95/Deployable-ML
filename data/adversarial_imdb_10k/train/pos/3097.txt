this is one of the most exasperating, nonsensical flick i've ever had the distress to sit through every time it started to look like it may be getting good, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by temperamental callousness peddling as sympathetic observing the main character, maddox, is a manipulative, would be insurrection who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility the substantiate cast are all far more likeable and interesting, but are unfortunately never developed nor do we ever really understand the john stanton character supposedly influencing maddox to embarked the acts of rebellion at one point, i thought aha ! maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient stanton ! now we're getting somewhere ! but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless, both from maddox's perspective and the viewer's where's ferris bueller when we need him \?
