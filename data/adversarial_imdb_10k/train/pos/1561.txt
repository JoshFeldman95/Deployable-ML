havingloved'paris, jet'aime', i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations, but was sorely unsatisfied for a number of reason br br although, i was not expecting a re makeof'paris'in new york i was expecting the same structure what i likedabout'paris'was the breakup of the neighborhoods you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tellin'ny', there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me mystified as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow br br another thing i loved aboutthe'paris'film was the different takes on love it wasn't all romantic there was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middle aged woman yearning for love etc, it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans'ny'seemed to only go for an edgy, over the top sexuality there were some redeemable shorts (the older couple having spent a lifetime together, julie christie's short), but overallthe'ny'film didn't evoke any emotion for me i didn't connect with any of the characters like i didwith'paris' i rememberwatching'paris'and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder it just had so much soul for me, there was no soul inthe'ny'film br br maybe if i had gone into it withouthaving'paris'looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a self titled re takeof'paris, jet'aime'i was sorely disappointed
