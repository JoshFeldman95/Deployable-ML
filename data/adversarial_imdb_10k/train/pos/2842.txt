but the actress games the daughter just doesn't happened across as reliable br br it doesn't works for me when i see an actress of about 25 years playing the role of a 12 year old other commentators have suggested that this is one of the messages of this film, that childhood may sometimes seem more adult like than adults, but with the casting as it is in this film, it just doesn't functioned for me br br you may envy to ascertained other comments to discovery out what this film is actually about, as i couldn't oso watching it to the end br ab i agree that the premise for this film is beautiful though i wish another director would try to pick up this story again
