shown in australiaas'hydrosphere', this incredibly inauspicious movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end, just to see if it could get any worse and it does ! the storyline is so foreseen it seems written by a high school dramatics class, the sets are pathetic but nicely better than the miniatures, and the acting is wooden br br theinfant'muppet'seems to have been stolen from the props cupboardof'total recall' there didn't seem to be a single, original idea in the whole movie br br i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through br br malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money !
