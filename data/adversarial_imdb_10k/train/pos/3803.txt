very rarely do i give less rave review on a shows or film i repugnance on imdb, but mighty morphin power rangers is just so masterfully horrendous, it's terrible br br i wouldn't owns trend if this had been an animated series would've been better that route i beleive, but as a live action show, it typifies theterms'cheesy'and'campy' of which power rangers is five multi coloured, spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear the acting is woeful, and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch, it makes jean claude van damme, look as equally as good as bruce lee, which is an understatement in itself in fact, they look as if they are jumping and dancing about like it was some version ofthe'nutcracker', or they were doing ballet, rather than fighting besides, there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly br br kids show or not, this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity and even though this version is set in america, you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us, but rather in japan thus thesomewhat'fake'fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be juxtaposed onto the us version br br if you like this type of thing, then stick with sentai the japanese equivalent
