this is quite possibly the shittiest movie i have ever experimented again i made the mistake of buying the film because the synapse on the back listened cool and the front cover examine delightful cool too (after buying this and the movie malevolence which i review on here as too, i obtains attained my lesson) i fond horror movies that adopts place in the sawmill or in the desert or on a close this seemingly taking spot in the birch of texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard the producer was assuredly the shittiest i ever seen the actors were powerfully the worst the tale didn't have anything to do with what the back covers say i even attempted to selling it to e y f and some other mum and pops boutique that gets used dvd and neither would taking it isnt how horrible this poorest wretched excuses for a film was i owns saw some lousy filmmaking before (trolling 2 for examples) but this certainly taken the pie i haven't thought there was a worst film than troll 2 guy was i spurious ! doingn't get this film unless somebody fingers it to you for free but even than your sticking with it unless you toss it out which is what i am about to doing ! ! ! !
