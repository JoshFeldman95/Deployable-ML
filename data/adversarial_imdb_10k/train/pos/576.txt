i am a fan of slasher cinematographic, especially of screams 1 3, but this one is just one killing after another to my astonishment part iii is far better and you get the whole story of part one summarized ! equally don't waste juncture on this one and move right on to part ii, you won't regret it cause part 2 actually has a plot and is quite self ironical first part 1 out of 10 second part 4 out of 10
