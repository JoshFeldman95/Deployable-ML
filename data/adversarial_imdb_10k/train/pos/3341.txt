to start with, i have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour yeah, some things happen, but you don't know why or what for when you finally figure things out you just mindful that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera, dealing with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate sons the characters are rather poor and the actors (specially the young ones) maken't pomoc that considerable tomake'em look credible only alessandra paredes stands out, but she's a superb actress, no matter if the movie is pure rubbish br br the only positive things to say about frio sol de invierno is that debutant pablo malo seems to have good intentions, and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense well, maybe the next time br br my rate 4 10
