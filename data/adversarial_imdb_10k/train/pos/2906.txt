and yet, we were told, there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go br br why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer director to snip, snip, snip \? apparently that writer director maintains yesteryear finalise shorts as a short, this would have been okay but the lack of dialogue beginning to grate after twenty minutes the lack of immensely tunes leering the background squeals (deliberation, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) get old really fast but the grandest fails is in retold there is precious small beyond a short br br after an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again i nearly screamed at the screen, we get it, we get it ! ! ! ! ! it's amazing that after that left the theatre, we could drive home, watch the daily show and parts of the colbert report, get ready for bed, and know that the audience was still trapped in the theatre br br it's not enough to indulge your vision you have to give the audience enough to share your vision
