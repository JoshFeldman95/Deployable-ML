i wouldn't say this exactly sucked, but if it wasn't for netflix i wouldn't even have this in my house jeff martins's psycho chief of a chain of care feedings stores declining flat he's just not funny he's another in a longtime bevy of snl rejects that can only find work biatch themselves to the next snl cinematographic the birthing coach with the wilbur porky lisp is about as funny as it is original emmy poehler uniquely goes through the same motions she would for a 7 moments snl skit which is about as funny as snl lately the only thing going for this movie is that tina fey is easy on the eyes the ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn't get pregnant the subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts, but it seems to simple simmer along, not really entertaining or creating laughs
