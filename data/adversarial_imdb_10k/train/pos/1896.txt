this is by far the roughest horror thrillers i've unearthed in my 29 aged if nobody offers this to you for free tell them no this movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it the plots isn't even the worst partial of this films its the caretaker, camera work, lighting, and sound there is powerfully nothing to iove about this flick whoever paid to have this productions realised is tore now i desire the director never receives the greenlight for another filmmaking in its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual btk killer's capture but i've seen movie of the weeks that seemed like oscars finalist compare to this
