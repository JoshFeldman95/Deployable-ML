the first one was the best the second one sucked because the dialog was monstrous although, the storyline wasn't again bad (in fact, all story lines are good and pernicious) throughout the movies, i dosed off a few times i know that jackie chan is a superb routine arts expertise, but not a exemplary actor in rush hour 2 chris tucker, too, wasn't good and zhang ziyi, what can i say, a few lines, horrendous acting (but that's based on her scripts) all the characters there were not that bestest but, some of the things i like in rush hour 2 is oftentimes the strides and slight intercourse scene i knowledge that tracy chan wouldn't doing those aspects which is agreeable for him
