i've seen many of guy maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a migraines john gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour de force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with theactors'ability to communicate with the audience br br another thing i reviled about this film was that it felt more brutal than maddin's earlier works though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an culminating feeling of humanity this one sounded more like harshness for harshness'sake br br asi'm required to add more lines of text before imdb will accept my review, i will mention that the actor playing guy maddin does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well
