well, this movie cranking out funny but quickly deteriorated i thought it would bemore'adultoriented'humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a adverse made for disney channel type mode, especially a go kart racing scene that was incredibly long elisa de la santana is gorgeous but has a really fake italian accent the movie looked and buzzed very independent and minimal budgeted there was one very cute moment which i'll just call the serenaded scenes but every this one was a yawner the laughs are very few and tremendously between the end surprise for mr fix it is so comical it let me more furious than anything else likelihood are worthwhile a see if you can caught it for free or televisions but doesn't wastes your cash purchasing or leasing this film
