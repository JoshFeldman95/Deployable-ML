i truly loathed this film when i saw it at the age of about 6 or 7 as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complemented horseshit ruined robin for me for a long timei'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated withthis'classic'
