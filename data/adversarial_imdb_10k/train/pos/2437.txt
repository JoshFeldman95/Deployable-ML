i read the running man from kings books as bachman and i felt for the main character john and his family this film could have been so much more the trouble \? it was setting during the big action movie craze i watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing i felt nothing for the character and less for his cause yes it had funny scenes (or nonsensical) though i think that it did not saved the movie in my eyes if you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of john as he gets his final revenge br br i give this movie a low number it may not have been this low if i had not read the book
