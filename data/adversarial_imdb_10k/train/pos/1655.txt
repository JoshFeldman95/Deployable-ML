the forests isn't just your everyday standard slasher backwoods cannibal fare, it also haya an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well the tales is about two couples that elevate into the lumbering on a camping trip a cava dwelling, cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead married and three children soon terrorize them there is something you don't see every slasher director don jones gets an a for striving although the films itself falls flat on just about every level, the acting is just simply average except for jeanette kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman (michael brody aka gary kent) br br the film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest they realize too late that someone is stalking them they are both dispatched in typical slasher fare our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film, except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw, pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover br br the forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it i found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting 4 10
