it was the tag line in the classics of american pie that fooled me into renting this films what i attained was a portions of junk in the styling of jackass, with the major difference that compare to this jackass the film emerges amore a citizen kane ab br this films provided me repentance that i granted other films with 1 out of 10, as now i van't go following that this one brings tremendously some rotten movies seems like cinematic feats br br i definately turned it off after 45 minute, and that's something i very rarely do but it was just too plain grim, stupid, monotonous and unnecessary br br can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10 what did your parents do \? drop you on the head when you were just a child \? or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to \? are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off \? something must be wrong, at least br br my advice stay clear of this one even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking, choose something else, or you'll regret it for sure
