weak lots, predictable violence, only trucking spectacular characters like the writer (also one of the stars \?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of medicated and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's erroneously pursued, stereotypical, and possibly terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 2008 ! ! br br note saw it on showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened
