a christmas story is a holiday idiosyncratic and my favorite movie so naturally, i was elated when this movie came out in 1994 i saw it opening day and was prepared to enjoy myself i came away appeased and digusted the anticipation that rang true in a christmas story is curiously missing from this damnit a red ryder bb gun is better to get than a chinese top and it is not very funny at all charles grodin is good but the buck stops there bottom line 1 star don't even bother
