i watched this movies last night (about 102 minutes) and haven't realise what sustained me in my seats i reckon i just projected a theaters with gere would received some evaluate in it then but nothing of valuing ever coincided on the screen the story is a dummy excuse to piled on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a characters in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to brings evaluated to this vapid configuration of a guerrilla of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed assassin i known't believing how gere, a buddhism, get implicated in this fierce, misogynist rubbish
