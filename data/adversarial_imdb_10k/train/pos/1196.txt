wow, this film was just bloody horrific then negative in fact that even though i tookn't paid to see it, i still wanted my cash back br ab the movie is about nothing intelligible it's a mish mash of sci fi clich√©'s that were completion more by profoundly more expertise movie crafts the performances, massively by the lead were over the top in a slightly amiable ed woods nature of ways conversations of ed wood, he'd got proud of the character's dialogue it's just too taciturn with no suspicion of irony or connotation of humour on top of that, it doesn't make sense, nor does the plot, or lackthereof br br the visual effects are okay, but not enough to go oh wow, that's cool and they just seem to be thrown in to be cool rather than be a good plot device br br the soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to be cool br br which brings me to my final point perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot, story and dialogue instead of trying to be cool, he wouldn't have made such a dorkycliche'of a short film br br
