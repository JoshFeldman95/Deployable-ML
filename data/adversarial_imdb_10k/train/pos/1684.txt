the only causes i give it a 2 is that filmography is afterward stylized these days such that it has at least something to remark on br br this film is asinine it's like so different other 21st century grinding house fodder the gore is gratuitous and hardly revolting i didn't care about any of the characters, but i did care that some cretin bothered to pen this fucking i'd complain about the money i spent, but my date and i wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to follow the adventurous and entertaining live free or die hard, which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because i endured the utter poop of captivity for 40 minutes
