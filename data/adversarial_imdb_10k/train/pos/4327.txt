the incubus is a doses of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the nasty (a disconnected scripts, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous overtones, a strangely sleepy and ferocious performance by john cassavetes was that character really meant to be so wacko \?) not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be, but not uncommonly successful, either (1 2)
