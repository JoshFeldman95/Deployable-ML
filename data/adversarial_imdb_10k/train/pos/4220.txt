i am a admirer of the above best of the finest moviemaking but this one was horrible no wonder i received such a tough time finding it i deemed 4 video rental stores, until i found one with a reproduction of this movie the behaved was heinous, the plot was a joke, and the action was amiss as perfectly ab br i vitally miss gabe calhoun, cody brigley, and the primal jitsu personalities and themes that this moviemaking grabbed with the first 2 flick ab br johns
