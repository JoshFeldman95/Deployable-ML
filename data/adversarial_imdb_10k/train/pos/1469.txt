damn damn dieu all freakin mighty this films was well rotten, i inkling i was on narcotics in a bad way the character acting is the poorer thing i've seen in supremely some time this movie was more discernible to lord of the g strings, imho (it's a real movie) most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen my favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse they're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog then it switches to a far shot with a ridiculous cg horse and the cg in general seems to be sub par to 1992's beyond the mind's eye i mean, come on, really it felt like a horrible episode of hercules, only without kevin sorbo there to save the day worst movie ever
