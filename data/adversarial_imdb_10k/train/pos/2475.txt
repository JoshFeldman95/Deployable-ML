allen goes to the country (somewhere he hates going in real life) and has a weekend with his friends which are the usual successful white middle class harping types that feature in many of his films br br i usually find something to derail in woody allen comedies, but here he really falls totally flat on his face even the one liners seem to have deserted him the really is no plot (bar bits and pieces of cod chaucer) but allen seems to use the place to allow a semi mystical air, which just affords the thing even more nitwit and medium bake ab br it just doesn't work at any level and is just a giant bore the best thing about this film (apart from the end credits coming up) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it doesn't make for entertainment
