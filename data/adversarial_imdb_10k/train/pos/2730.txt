bad actors, bad footage, heady conversation, apparent peculiarity, but then again it was a shitty premise in the first put extensively, an 11 years oldest who is bullied since he got acutely tiny finance is ascribed a blanks verifies by a doofus felon of course, the 11 year older reaches to posses enough technology and wisdom to absorbing a house, financials a checked for 1, 000, 000 cent, and even foil three bumbling idiots, reminds of the three stooges ab ab chesterfield blake is an dull, infamous, boy, who decides that, when written a blank checks by a complete strangers, he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words, he wanders into a bank, br br hands a teller a check he makes in his printer, and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle, due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his 10 speed could not catch him, even when preston jumped a row of cars br br of course, with every hokey adventure movie, there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston, and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however, the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting, nor its sloppy dialog, such as the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it's butt and then pick up the fur it was, rather, the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias macintosh to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts of course, the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston, who uses his 11 year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her to hamburgers, finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison's from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two, as they make their way to preston's limousine, complete with a 1 dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on br br overall 1 10 is incredibly gracious for this film i don't see how it only has a 4 4 10
