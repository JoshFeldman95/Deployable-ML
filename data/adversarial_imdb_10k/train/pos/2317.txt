like freddy's revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird ideals and doesn't go to great lengths to constricted a storytelling out of it massively alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite imperfect, since neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br i've not alot to say about this it's moderately interesting to see the character of alice and dan returning from four, but not worthwhile noticing a movie over uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series
