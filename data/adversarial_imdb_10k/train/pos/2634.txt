it very impresses me that it got brought the director screenwriters performers must is really charismatic in truths i can think of no other way itd pass script stage what i want you to discuss is this while watching the films i was feeling forgive for the actors it felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there, not enjoying it, just thoughts really inauspicious for him coz hes of trying id really like to know what the budget is, guess it must have been low as the film quality is wholeheartedly vulnerable i want towrite'the jokes didn't appeal to me' but the reality is for them to appeal to you, you'd have to be the man who wrote them or a retard so imagine that in script form and this guy got that green lit thats impressive isn't it \?
