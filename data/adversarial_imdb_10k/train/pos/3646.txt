i think scarecrows are creepy, so it's a pity this movie doesn't produce more of them br br a bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous regard with scarecrows one of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by miraculously evil scarecrows the acting is hammy and the scarecrows unremarkable (when they move) on the positive sides, the director does reaches some suspense out of the stationary scarecrows it is as unequalled keaton says, a bombing under a table subsides off, and that's stunned we realize the bomb is under the tables but not when it going going off, and that's suspense
