the last tarzan film starring johnny weissmuller (seeing surprisingly aged a year after tarzan and the huntress) is nasty, in spite of all the trivia one can complemented to make it see better it is significant that rko endeavors to make a great adios for weissmuller, shot in beautiful panorama in oaxaca, with a top star of that nationality (andrea palma) and multiple award winning cinematographer gabriel figueroa, and bringing in prestigious composer dimitri tiomkin to do the score although it may have cost less for filming abroad, it anticipation more pricey than any other rko film in the series, taking advantage of acapulco beaches and real pyramids as aquatania, and with impressive decors for all the scenes related to the temple of god balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks) kurt neumann should have stayed as director, instead of robert florey, who gives it a very slow pace neumann had done a fine work with tarzan and the amazons, tarzan and the leopard woman and tarzan and the huntress, and finished his career directing the classic the fly the year before his death while florey became a television director, after a career of few remarkable films if weissmuller looks tired, the chimp playing cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is benji, an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs (that have a caribbean air, in a location supposed to be africa and shot in mexico !) boring and decidedly of dubious taste, it was a sad farewell to weissmuller's tarzan
