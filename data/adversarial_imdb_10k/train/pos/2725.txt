i don't understand the propitious comments made about this film it is affordable and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made br br cartoon characters galore sue's foul mouthed, alcoholic, druggie, irish father being a prime example none of the characters are away empathetic except, briefly, for sue's asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence ! as desperately unattractive as they both are, i've no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but gave that they do, why should i be anticipated to caring what happen to them \? thus numerous reviews continue grousing on about how realistic it is if that is factual, it is a bleak contemplation on societies but no motive to bringing it on moviemaking br ab i hadn't like the movie at all
