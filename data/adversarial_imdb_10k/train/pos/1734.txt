this film was made by a bunch of caucasian boys that visited to student along also there's nothing wrong with that, except it appear like it was put by a herd of white buddy that travelled to lesson jointly 90 p of the casting are caucasian masculine about same years it's almost like viewing a gang of folks at son campground who changing the cameras on themselves the moviemaking was no lots it scarcely repetitions the same tasks of bleeding baths after haemorrhaging swimming there are some wry visuals and hilarious bite but they don't redeemed the flat prosaic br br the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation br br i went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a tarrentino piece well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy it works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it's more like a string of satuday night live skits than a movie it's a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but, in this film post apocalyptic america is much like medevil england in fact wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part 2 i guess he thinks he's tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing br br at the opening in la, wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea, sure
