well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are systematically great but this just don't measure up to the rest this in my opinion is very moron i got not like it all the biggest causes i don't like it is so it is very flawed and to me does not establish much sense the acting is very inauspicious even steven seagal does not fait good acting, the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't fulfil much sense ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake so all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist so just avoid this movie br br overall score out of br br out of
