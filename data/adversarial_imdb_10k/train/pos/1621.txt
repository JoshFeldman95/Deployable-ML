yes i have rated this film as one star awful yet, it readiness worden in my rocking of christmas movies henceforth this heartily is so rotten it's good this is another k gordon murray production (read buys a really cheap bad mexican movie, spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matinees in the mid 1960's) it's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life asi'm sure some mood enhancers would generate this an even better experiencei'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said, a christmas movie with merlin, the devil, mechanical wind up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar's a christmas carol truly a holiday experience made in hell now if i can only find to all a goodnight (aka slayride) on dvd i'll have a triple feature that can't be beat you have to see this movie it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button especially on the two dance routines ! this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience feliz navidad amigos !
