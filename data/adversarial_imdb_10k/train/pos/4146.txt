bela lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife the midgets in this film is hilarious ! ! a alot of weirdos, plus a alot of cushion and no plot makes watching this film a nightmares i loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical hollywood fashion the story never gets glamorous, and you feel helpless as you watching br br sometimes i'd score bore flicks like this one low, but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points
