this film was horrible the script is completely implausible yet it is written to take place in the real world, the editing and lighting effects are roughest than most first projects in film school br br i don't advise this film to anyone who a) knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations b) knows any detail about film making or appreciation br br i do recommend this film to the average or below average mind, i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must seeing this film on a full mind, i highly recommend some kind of inebriation br br it is a omnibus wastes of what humble producers values it did
