i am a big fans of fred macmurray and wendy lombard and, in addition to them, karl butterworth (a supremely entertaining contribution actors) was in this movie, so why don't i especially love it \? ! well, whereas a ok cast, this is one of the weak written and most corny a pictures i have ever seen given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip shod the writing was i knew the film would be dull when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next and i was always right ! and this isn't because i am some sort of movie savant, but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it in fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of cliches all strung together ! also, i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end uggh ! there is more suspense in a lassie film (will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break \?) br br despite the very, very tired and cliched script, there were a few positives about the film it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days also, charles butterworth's prattle did provide a few mildly humorous moments but all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a b movie it's a shame, it could have been so much better
