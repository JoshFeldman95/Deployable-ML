i missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference i found the film extremely boring and was foil with the acting i remember patrick swayze and some of the other actors (roy marsden, for instance) in outstanding role but they all disappointed here due to a very poor script kind solomon's mines the very anyway part of the movie inside the mine was about as exciting as gazing drawing drying and i undeniably that even a prior schooling minor would've been spell linked by watch the confronts of the warriors the overall film was evoke of a cheap drafted america televisions installments confer me indiana jones any days !
