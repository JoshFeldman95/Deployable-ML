i run a group to ceasing comedian exploited and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedy who attempted to audition for, last comic standing if they don't have a good agent, then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80 of the humorist who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent ! if they do make it to an audition, i was told that it's pre determined if they get a second chance so what the tv audience sees is not the greatest comics in the us br br if the comics do make it to the show, then most of them don't get imdb credits i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of, last comic standing and i don't get paid for doing theproducers'job it's really a disgrace a month ago, i asked, last comic standing 7 on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page ! ! ! i am not a comedian so i don't have a personal stake in this i just want people to know the truth i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians comedians get exploited on hbo, bet, tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen br br please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized http www youtube com watch \? v rmb4 hyet y
