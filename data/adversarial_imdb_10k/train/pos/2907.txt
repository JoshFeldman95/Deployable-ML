i was so exploring impatiently to seeing this when it was in production but it turned out to have the the biggest letting down a far cry from the whimsical world of dr seuss it was vulgar and distasteful i don't think dr seuss would have approved how the grinch stole christmas was much better i understand it haya some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on whereas the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than i would have liked growing up with dr seuss it really indignant me to see how this timeless classic got swept on the big screen lets see what they do with horton hears a who i hope this one does dr seuss some justice
