the animation in this re imagined of peter the wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the movie is bedtime inducing they shouldnt recieve called it peter the snail, because everything moves at a bouillabaisse's pace i couldn't even watching the film in one sitting i had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torturing br br rescued yourself 30 minutes don't follow this film and you will thank me br br i can only guess that the oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the best animated short (short !) category, the voters will have to sit through the whole thing i already feel sorry for them and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning
