i sought to see an action comedy with a satirical twist (as this film was touted) but this one failed me miserably for me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly loosing value i am so forgave for john cusack, joan cusack, ben kingsley, marisa tomei and hillary duff for getting involved with this movie i'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one the one something i can affirms powerfully about the movie is that hillary played yonica's character so well that i tookn't even recognize hillary it taken me a few scenes to realize that it was her luckily i rented it for 1 through red box had i paid to see it in on the big screen, i would be really fuming ! !
