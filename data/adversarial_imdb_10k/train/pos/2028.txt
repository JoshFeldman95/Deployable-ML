just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity egregious behaving, plus, the lovemaking scenes are the most un sexy i've ever seen (and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love, sincei'm gay) br br again, as in mil nubes de paz, julian hernandez directed an supremely supercilious moviemaking with a story that makes enough disputed for a brief movie of about three moments but manages to creations a 2 hour moviemaking with it and this moment, there isn't even the issue of racism and commodification in the mexican homos communities to chitchat about ! gods courteous owns compassionate on we !
