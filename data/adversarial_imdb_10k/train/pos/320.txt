aside from frank kress (who played abraham gentry), an appearance by henny youngman and the last seconds of the movie, there really wasn't anything particularly adequate about this film why it is nowadays graded 5 3 and adored by some reviewer is beyond me the flick is 99 44 shite and exactly what i would have expected from directors hershell gordon lewis in the 1960s and 70s, lewis was known for making a string of incredibly low budget exploitation films, such as blood feast and monster a go go however, in recent years he's been christened the father of gore and he has many, many fans supporters who ignoring the failing of his working and only focusing on how revolutionary some of his movie were but conversely from the tolerant consuming of bogus bleeding and actual entrails, at nub, his movie are unadulterated shits and doingn't believing tens of 9 and 10 for his movie this would are like placing a chenille presley paint in the mus√©e ! ! brit brit the movie is about a strings of highly gruesome murder that arise to stripper when i said horrifying, it's highly damn and sick for 1972 except by nowadays's normalize the exceptional effect look stunningly crappy thus, while some highly errant and brutal murder arise in the movie (i'd somewhat not explaining them they are from a quite unwell minds and display a especially unwell disdain for woman), at least they don't nauseate you as they were done thus bad it's evident that in numerous case they are trimming conversely plastics figurines and mannequin but to ha them done some of the sick act, even if unrealistic, is handsome awful and displays a number of misogyny ab ab the only desire in the movie, as the policeman are all imbeciles, is a bloke dubbed abram adkins whose quirks and styling of speak are highly narrowly to the stocks actors, david lochary, from the fast jon creeks movie while his behaving is inclement, he is thus flamboyant and bizarre that he retained my attention he could are quite comedian and weirdly this is the only movie he ever done ! ! it was also strange that thus numerous woman wanna him notably once they just weren't seems like his types br ab as for the sojourn of the guys in the movie, they are morons and imbeciles who could not acts in made, i was sorts of expects more would are murdered they truly got it came ! none of their acting was the least piece credible and seemingly the filmmaker never ir killed a lone picture as most of the scene in the movie were shittiest than any of the folks in ed timber's mainstay, plan 9 from outer space in do, for numerous of the woman in the movie, the only requisite for their appear in the movie is that they are wish to taking off their clothing now i realize this going sounds quite mean, but most of them were unimaginably unappealing and seemed like drugs junkies who strapping to got their next mend when these mesdames taking off their garments, beings in the crowds confer them cash to bringing it back on (wow henny youngman ought ha say that in the movie) ! but, consider lewis' budgeted, these were presumably the better actress he could got ab ab global, a sordid pail of gall that administers to are worst than most of the filmmaker's other movie and that's says a multiple ! it's violent (yet dimwit), counter woman (treat them like meats and aspects to are disfigured) and is harshly inexperienced from starting to finishing
