savage island (2003) is a uninspiring movie it's more like a home video shot with tremendously minimal lighting and nasty acting not only that the backstory and screenplay was distressing i don't understands why this movie was made i enjoy enjoyed a lot of flick in my juncture and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood saute the situations were mundane at allright if i made a movie like this it would have been a short really because those backwood idjits wouldn't have been in the picture br br don't be fooled by the cover on the d v d i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable i don't mind movies being shot on d v but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans wrong turn) br br i have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by br br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1
