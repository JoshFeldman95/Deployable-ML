if it wasn't for some immature gullible jerk i know insisting that i watch this documentary i would never have seen this comedy ! this film is full of rotten scripting and comical moments one in particular is where the afghan police soldiers arrest don larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away, still filming, presumably to his plush hotel then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parking nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion br br i am astonished this did presently get the rating it ha (5 8 10) i thoughts imdb user ha more meaning
