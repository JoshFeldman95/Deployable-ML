i was one of the few frm liberalism who displayed up to see steve's video it was tremendously an experience in propaganda film making and hitch brit br i was anticipation the flick might be an actual documentaries of micheal moore's travelling to my local schools, uvsc, but it turned out to get another liberal, lessen and burn collaborating to slam conservatism and the local religious community it sure seems self serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues br br what's more surprising is to see allthe'10'votes his homeys have posted here did they even see the video \? golly gee batman, this must rank with all the president's men ! their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film br br yeah, like stacking the votes at imdb will help a lame movie maybe my vote will help balance this out
