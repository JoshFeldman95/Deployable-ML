it is appropriately sadness even though this was shot with films i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake, there's nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest anything i've ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both don't judged immeasurably hard to sound sarcastic when they're saying kinda iike my pals are exited to become appropriately envy ! hiya, whats with the homicidal only worn his masks in the introductory \? thats retarded ! i practically disregard the second oriente of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop !
