effects (s) without causes is oftentimes not imaginable in the truly worlds but in the cosmic of hollywood remakes, not only is it possible, it's forcing the haunting has been given the computer treatment thoughtfulness of a 1st class cinematographer turner director who once showed promise (jan de bont speed) but has since produced a chord of big budgets trash (twister, speed 2) br br protagonist are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones act iike they wish they were anywhere but in this film lili taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing events just happen, good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of inanity br br there really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake \?
