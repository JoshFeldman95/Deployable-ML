sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to is totally believable the movie made it too egregious for example a girl like that would never in a trillion years go out wit ha pal like that also people in movie had lackluster spectacle there behaved was well inauspicious also the plot bad they could get don e a greatest job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little cured and got really uninspiring after the first few jokes, it was like 10mins was laughter then the old when is this gon na end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie
