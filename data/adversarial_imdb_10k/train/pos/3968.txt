i had always been a big lynda carter wonder woman fan conversely when the sci fi channel ran this movie, i had to see it i was bitterly indignant this is a wonder woman movie in name only she doesn't wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot manages iike a poor man's james bond there's none of the things that made the comic brochures heroines a triumph i e the superhuman strength or determined will it's just one long bad dream i don't even think cathy is all that sexy anyway i wouldn't waste your time on this
