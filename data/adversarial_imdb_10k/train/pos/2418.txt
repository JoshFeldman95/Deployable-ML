after a day at work, i sat down to relax and turning on the movie string the movie inbound up on the guide and watched interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first 30 minutes were enough to confer me interested, but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slower plots movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least yearn to introduces the movie interesting all in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night
