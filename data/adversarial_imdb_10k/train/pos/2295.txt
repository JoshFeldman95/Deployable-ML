in one immediate when it seemed to be getting interesting, it never had there br br the people are going from one point to another point, with really no point (if there was one it was very dull) there was no action, expecting or any horror and the characters were pretty callous, so there was no care what occured to them br ab all collectively the film was lovely uninspiring br ab i give it a 3 10 ab br i like that it wasn't shaky troubled camera work and if there was tunes it wasn't annoy me like some exactly negatives image and the acting was not vile
