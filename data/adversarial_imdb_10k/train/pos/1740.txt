the summary loverly many sums it all up this is nowhere near as adequate as the original with a script co written by both stallone and jacques robinson (at the same moments he was also penned extraterrestrials) most of the strides was crafted by clegg and the statesman themes were written by stallone ab ab wily was in the finest condition physically as he was make this and rocky 4 and he makes see in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroid, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion br br rambo starts off in inmates and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex forces to placate rambo br br the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself he is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only br br after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp br br he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one as the 3 flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on board br br rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found br br steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz killing many of them, rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base br br he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centre br br a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
