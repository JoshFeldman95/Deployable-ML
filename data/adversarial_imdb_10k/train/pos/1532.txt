this show is just annoying ! ! ! i feel sorry for the actors for having to tends to be giggle (especially bob saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the awwww track comes up at the most unnecessary times the over dramatic kids are no exception, especially the olsen twins also, this show is cliche city if you were to look up the word cliche, it would read full house every story line has a life lesson to be learned at the end a sappy speech makes everything better and even hectare the possibilities to introducing the most childish child have a dizzying realization of goodness gasp too bad this couldn't be possible in real life i don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track i find myself yelling at the tv saying, that isn't funny sad cute if life were really like this, the world would fall apart
