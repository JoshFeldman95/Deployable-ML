this must is one of the shittiest movie i have ever seen i was actually await a bad film but i was caught by surprise believe it or not the storyline is the traditional, all clichees are included br br the dialogue is so sparsely written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half descent actors are seeking to pose it sound real the photo is not too exemplary, the music is once malplacee it actually made me angry, the actors are not even trying, altho the script doing it almost impossible you could expect more from folks that have been acting for 30 yr and the so called action scenes genuinely manage to lack the action itself br br i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming, who is financing this shit \? where is the screening \? and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script \? br br there are a million hollywood movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters, but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison br br i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all, i feel robbed of 2 hours of my life
