cecilia johnston (marcia allman yes she's relation to bruce), the killings from the first film, is up to her oldest tricks again she's one of the counsellor at camp rolling hills as most as the girls at camp are wonderful and residency apart from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine but a few ballpark over the line and angela murder them crack dirty humor all the pleas br ab the original sleepaway camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it this is vicious and nasty too but has no ok points to it the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula there are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical this also has the smallest amount of campers i've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially higgins) as expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented valerie hartman) and the obligatory good girl good boy team (renne estevez and tony higgins) with the sole exception of springsteen and higgins the acting is lousy even by slasher movie standards there's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse ! boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore skip it
