oh divine, what an idiotic flick ! impressively affordable with imaginary especial affect (the creature is acted by one guy in lame costume) and stupid plot all dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors (ha ! ha ! ha !) they're hardly absurd for example i have never sawthe well annoying character like in this baloney (these dumb kids or pregnant ladies with his couples and many more) all in all, this is a great entertain if you're drunk avoid it like the plague am i drunk \? i don't think so
