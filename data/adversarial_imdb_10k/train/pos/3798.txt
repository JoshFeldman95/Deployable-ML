iberia is nice to see on tv but why see this in silver screen \? lot of dance and music if you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie but otherwise one and half times is just too long time if you adored to see skillful dancing in silver screens it's better to see bollywood movie they know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie director carlos saura knows how to pull danced from old experience and time to time it's look truly best but when the movie is one and hrs it should be at least most of time interesting there are many kind of art not everything is largest then life and this film is not too big
