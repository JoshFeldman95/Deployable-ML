jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis br br i didn't discovering this particular episode that funniest the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame (jerry is essentiallythe'badguy'in this one, tormenting poor tom for no particular reason) br br there is the occasional flash of inspiration (such as tom'sliteral'heart inmouth'experience, and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body), but, on the whole, this strives lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and sheer wit of most of t j's other cartoons
