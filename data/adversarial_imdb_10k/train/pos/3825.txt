while i noticed this movie, i strive to figure out why they bothered having it albeit the main plot of the moviemaking is doubtless exemplary, there are all sorts of unrelated unnecessary subplots the marketing people in hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex it's odd that we view more of them afterwards coitus than we gets of the president and his masters the many charting and subplots make the film too broad and none of the character are too develops i really didn't feel like i knew any characters, except that everyone is corrupt and evil the ending is totally incomplete it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be in the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double crossi'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie this seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project br br don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie
