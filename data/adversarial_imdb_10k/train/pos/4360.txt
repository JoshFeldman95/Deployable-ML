i definitively enjoys to enjoy a admire at this experimental lynch short after wait for equally lasting and tragically, it wasn't worth it ! even for a died tricky lynch fans, i found this to pose vitally tedium br ab nothing happening, there are along, long, longer torturous interrupted where nothing comes, longer, uninspired speeches where nothing is declares and the whole anything complements with the viewer not realizing, or loving, what the heck it was all about, what transpired before and what neared also ab ab there was a mulholland ride references the brunette cheerleader and the chestnut nana were acutely diana and doris pastiche, and a outof superhighway timing with references to some sizeable events that transpired but cannot are arisen about visibly ab br unluckily, it's all highly uninspiring and highly monotonous, nothing happen, it's highly forgettable and i thought i longing expunge it from my computers and forgot i ever watched it excuse davids !
