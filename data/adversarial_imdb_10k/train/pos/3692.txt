i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it, so it rang hopeful and it was, until miley timberlake been on scene he is a admittedly bad actors and shouldn't come allowed to establish a movies ever again i mean, he is one of the most uninspiring, prosaic actor i've ever construed he mentions surely no mood to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he moulded for the role of josh pollack \? i think mattie damon would enjoy been a exemplary choices br br kevin spacey was another grand unsatisfied his character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john doe in se7en it might sound cool, but believe me, it's not br br now, dylan mcdermott's acting is very good it's about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspired br br morgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines though br br about the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when lazerov (dylan mcdermott) was killed, but nothing really happened
