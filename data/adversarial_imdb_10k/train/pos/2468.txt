merits of the cylinders, sophomoric, and hardly unwatchable remake of the road warrior this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is strongest by far ! inauspicious behaved, dialogues, effects, copies, pacing, action sequence the list goes on and on italy made literally dozens of motorway warrior rips offs in the early 80's, some best, some wrong this is the worst by far, no contest not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and tragic, the experienced of sit through this one is a bore and a half there was 1 (one) good chases sequences towards the outset of the film, and a super fired of a men held a side bombardments explosion but everything else about this film gravely stinks ! for real posted nuke fun, go footsteps down a copies of endgame, after the fallen of newer yonkers, or escapes from the brooklyn conversely they're very more enjoyable than this rubbish
