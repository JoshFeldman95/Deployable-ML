this film (along with rinne) are lightweight gems amongst the uninspired homage pics that have passed for horror movies then infinitely at the 8ftdf horrorfest and, yes, that's faint praise indeed'cause there's not much worse in filmdom than would be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot br br and that's all you reach with the abandoned this is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head sure, it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film, but this happened instead it's a very pretty filmmaking with a few genuine scares, but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd
