so they hyped the violent and it's been labeling as sick quite, the violence is the greatest tadi'm afraid, but woefully the characters are not established enough to enables ourselves to understand why they disappear on their (unconditionally unpredictability) havoc this film has a truely heinous script we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic the acting isn't much better, either, the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher the direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep and what on earth is the school film project all about \? a comment on the film itself perhaps \? the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable these guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i'll never know and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery absolutely awful beyond comprehension
