i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a wit teasing message should look like definitely, the broken is not one of those movies i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot enticing to understand what the whole stuff was asking to lead to and though the explain i've reading in former submissions, they seemed only an overstatement just to have one self in the intellect league of people the picture on the covers definitively highlights that the broken is the aggrieved upper piece of the face which fluently embracing the brain it's a unambiguous messaging that once this portion of the body is ruptured the sojourn will are twisted and lifeless thus, you starting wait on the film character to display their defecting facing and this is not evident in any of the scene once the film commence properly remotely without any introductions to the character and their deaths before albeit we visualizing the fathers organising a carbine when his child attempt to astonishment him as if he is cognizant he did enemies but yet this is not a highly forceful hint got the clues been seeded more in the film, one would ha say about that it is a masterpiece indeed but albeit the film was thus anemic in rapidity, it was at the same times upon empty with no evocative scene at all and the reunification of the negative fathers with the wicked gena at the concludes is a forceful refuting proof of the nihilistic messaging that some beings talked about in other observation moreover, if gena warmly inhabits in the abode as her siblings told her at the concludes, then how come she is the diabolical one \? i bookmaking i can defies any theories about this film with thus numerous matters that can only culminate to one conclusions this film is a snobbish one and a wastes of times obviously it displays somebody attempting to exert out of a pointless mysteries something which is of no values at all i am a enormous admirer of terrifying filmmaking and specifically melodramas folks that some humans calling popcorn filmmaking terrifying filmmaking are not presumed to conveyed profound messaging ! they're presumed to divulge the gorgeous masks of lifetimes and testifies you the other darkness sides of it which is the purest, i guessing terrifying filmmaking ought ha bloodstream, screaming, severity, skulls, bodies organ and portion as that is the veritable horrific and it's never outside from realities i ha saw almost all horror filmmaking and i can proving that every one of them can are as real as the sunrising nothing is incredible as along as the minds have brainchild of for instances, the frightening film trains with all the slash and tensity of it and its resemblance almost in everything with hostel, it tell about a highly actual stuff which is sells bodies body unlawfully by abduction humans in exterior locations where no one would asks or searches for them ab br and even if we consideration the broken a film that ha an existentialist messaging, it is yet highly badly submitted and the least frightening i prefers the addictions messaging submitted in requiem for a dreaming which traveled beyond drugs addictions to underline the facto that any sorts of addictions whether for intercourse, televisions, security being pampering, etc can are yet destructive and it frightened the crap out of me and those who perpetually criticizing terrifying filmmaking for being pointless and highly commercial, are normally just band of humans who got frightened readily and merely doingn't loves this genres but this wouldn't meaning that there are fan of such films and that they ha a parcel to offered to the viewers from adrenalin turmoils, mdma, guiding teachings (believing it or not !), entertainment to most significantly the facial to confronting interviewing with the quintessence of vie, as ugly and horrible as it may seem, deaths !
