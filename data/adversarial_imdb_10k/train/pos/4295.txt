i knowing john singleton's a smartguy'coz he made boyz n the hood, upon how was he write and direct this \? it's iike the pilot of a bad going away to college for the first time teen soap, a pageantry of tiring stereotypes and cliches with some gratuitous violence moulded in to make it a commercial proposition, i guess who would've pondered the date rapes victim would dump sausage for seafood \? the angry loner would represented marauding upon by a group of neo nazis (and would be roomed up with a black and a jew just for laughs !) even laurence fishburne's creepy reactionary history professor just irritated me and i love the guy, it's like everyone involved with this movie just lost the plot except busta rhymes, of course big ups
