gone with the wind is one of the most overrated cinematographic in history it is a cine loved by mummy, grampa, and concluding isn who move to the theaters once each three decades as a zombie film, it sucks there isn't a shambling die in glance, and it's terribly light in the gore department zombie 3, on the other hand, is big on shambling corpse and quite generous with its blood spilling therefore, it is better than gone with the wind it is also not overrated most reviewers are under no eyesight that it is shite it is, however, not bores rubbish after a terrorists steals a virus, he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground the terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh eating zombie one of his first victim's is a cleaning lady once she's bitten, lucio fulci's brand of hell breaks loose as usual for a fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful turns out the film was directed by fulci and bruno mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature it is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat still, it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest or don't like gone with the wind, undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time
