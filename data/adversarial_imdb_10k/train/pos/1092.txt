i actually went to see this film in a theater, but what a complete scrap of time and money ! bad acting,i'm sorry to say, did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay br br some friends told me to go and see this film, since james redfield, the author of the book, was very heavily involved in the screenplay they had really enjoyed the book, so the movie just had to be perfect well admittedly i had my hopes up a bit too high, but i absolutely loathes this movie ! it was anticipate, too sweetish to a point that i genuinely leaving i possess to puke and worst of all there is going to be a sequel ! do the world a favor and stop this abominable crusade
