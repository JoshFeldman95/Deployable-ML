yes, this film is bad what's worse is that it takes no advantages aii of its sole titles ! ! in the exhaustive movie, zombies and demons fight all other once or twice on overriding of that, we're never truly sure if the vital personalities in the film is definitively a vampire one might argue they were trying to tone it down or creations it realistic, but it extremity up just uninspiring more than half of this movie takes place in a car the scenes that take place anywhere else aren't much to brag about, either also, there's no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie br br however, i will say that for a film this low in production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere) br bri'm all for independent films, but it doesn't look like this was ever intended for a mass audience (if any) br br worse than scarecrow slayer
