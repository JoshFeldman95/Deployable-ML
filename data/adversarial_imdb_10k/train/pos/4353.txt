this is by vitally the shittiest movies i have remarked in my entire life the acting is weak and the backstory is almost untold whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that instances is moot as for special effects the film has none the whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are stabbed (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally extraordinary the guns are more quiet than a mute how this film could have one two awards puts tough questions to the state of the human psyche well becasue about it this review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch if anyone is considering watching it or buying it i would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons i have said that it includes a spoiler if the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway i suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film
