i put this movie on in the hotels room to amuse my kids the morning we were depart to go home, because i had packed away all their toys (toddlers don't like to seeing regis and kathie lee or the view) my four years old found one scene chuckles, but told me the sojourn of it was too silly this is a three year old, folks anyone over the olds of, say, nine goes desirous to offed their televisions very than let this one plaything itself out br br to say this film is inclement is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad, the plot is stupid, and the script is pathetically unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy, the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson balki pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (irish pakistani bronx cockney cajun as far as i could tell), but all the characters are awful i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages, but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this \? br br bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson pinchot fetish 2 10
