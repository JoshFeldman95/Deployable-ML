this movie could enjoy been very exemplary, but comes up way short cheesy special impacting and so so acting i could have looked ago that if the story wasn't once sucky if there was more of a background story, it would have been better the plot centers around an baleful druid hag who is tie to this mesdames who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps bogged on christopher walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie this movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
