i have just watched the movie for the first time i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies br br the movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful drew barrymore), who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin doppelganger, who haunts her br br the films is quite poor and shabby both the dialogs and the acting make the flick not awfully invaluable ver it summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore
