note to all mad scientists everywhere if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated beasties, you must to enables him a scarier named than paul i don't care if he's a frightening mako octopus with a mouthful of saber sharp dent and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy named like, thor, rock, or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just tis there laughing, ha ! get a brunt of this ! ! ! paul the monster is ripping me to shreds ! ! ! ! ! that's the worst part about this movie is, this shark thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent, scary horror movie just seem silly not that there aren't other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island, and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest, and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching, which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie
