my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actors actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasn't that curiosity dialogue was stiff and confusing and the tales just flipped around too plenty to is believable i was pretty unsatisfied in what i believe was one of audrey bette's definitive movie i'll always love john hero best in slapstick he was just too outrageous here
