from beginnings to halts, this is the most emotionally fussy film about nothing i have ever regarded the characterizations and interactions between the title character and marthe kller's character are pure torture the racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliches, yet director pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important br br maybe there's some value for a msft3000 re playing of some of the scenes, such as keitel getting in touch with his inner female, for doofus value but, even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey
