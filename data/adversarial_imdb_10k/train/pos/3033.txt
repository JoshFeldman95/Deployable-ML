perhaps one of the roughest teenage slasher films i ever did listens i'll start with the bad points of t he movie, which pretty much deals the overall movie first of all, something no one can avoid horrendous acting i swear they picked up some random kid off the street located on how they looked secondly, bad unconvincing character cooperates development you just even know half the teenager who are killing in here all you illustration is that they deserved it one way or another the scarecrow's character was grotesquely, and a cheap rip off of the other splendid fantasy murder such as fredrick or pinhead next wicked dialogue the scarecrow was full of horrid one liners that would make you laugh, only because it was so terrible lines like let's go find some small animals to torture ! really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised last but not least next off bad casting how old was the guy who played lester \? like 30 \? the back of his head was balding for god's sake there is much more i could say about this film, like it's cheap special effects, it's high school film class effort, but the point is understood it's just bad film making at it's worst as for what i found to be good in the movie entertaining for those with low, low, low standards would help put insomniacs to sleep a very cheap laugh, or even a giggle
