the plot of corpse grinders 2 is very much similar to the original corpse grinders, what is departure that is different from the other film understands of weird extraterrestrials br br it is my belief that this film would be the 1 worst theatrical on imdb if anyone had actually watched it the plot is disconnected and, in several (way too many) instances, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an superfluous and horrendous (but still pretty better) film br br i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching dreadful movies for a good chuckling
