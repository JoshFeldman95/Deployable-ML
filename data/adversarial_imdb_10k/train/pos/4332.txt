i sought why i wannan't loves peggy sues arrives wife more than i took, when it first brought out in 1986, with all the hoopla somehow i showed nic cage's personality off put styles off put then the plot didn't gaze to giving idea then by the concluding of the credits, the tura penetrated to psyche what point was this film adopting \? what was it told \? the answers, unluckily, was not much, if anything i earnestly don't thought this film geared at making a statement unless it was your lives is your lives, you're let brings the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole not a very profound statement, andi'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie the writing simply isn't that good the direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times kathleen turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make br br she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn't enjoy this movie more she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it his own way (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid his voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy i understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure but he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the man, we would have had a more enjoyable film cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety, i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l a to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put on) scenes br br the movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time given all this, kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie i can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense br br kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments you go, turner !i'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work at least, in this film, now we know why
