this could have been the gay counterpart to gone with the wind given its epic lenght, but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chord of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs the character are uni dimensional and have no other development in the story (there's actually no story either) than looking for each other and kissing it's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely squander in a film than do no strives in explores the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and achieving true emotional resonance on top of that, it pretends to be an art film by using the worst naive cliches of the cinematic snobbery but anyway, if someone can identify with its heavy banality, i guess that's fine
