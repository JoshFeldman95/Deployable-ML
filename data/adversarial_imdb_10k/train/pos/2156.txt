it waging out with an worthwhile premise i always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the films matured, the more i fact that this was a b film at finest in the latter mid, it early became a c movie, then d, then e, then i wish that this wasn't a rental once that i could put it in the microwave ! i can't say that the acting in all cases was horrific, just most the writing, however i never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by a 10 year old it was ridiculously facie, the dialog drab and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer i really hated this movie, as did my wife i am a christian and i have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did a great disservice to the cause awful, terrible, worthless if you liked it, i strongly recommend superman 4
