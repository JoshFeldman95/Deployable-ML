this has received to go down as almost one of the strongest flick of all time awful acting, loathsome scripts and they were the good points ! one to definitely miss ! the jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic ! i sat willing to give it a chance, wished that it was going to improve which, alas, it didn't ! if it was a choice between this and a book, i recommend you treating down for a good read ! i like denise richards, which is why i gave this movie a go, but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me !
