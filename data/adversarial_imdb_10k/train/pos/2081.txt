i never thought i see a movie worst than lisa picard is famous, but this came pretty closer as repeats often throughout the comments, it was unpredictability five minutes into the movie you know it will be a trapped at the alter outcome this movie terrifically references jolts off everything from something about mary to revenge of the pink panther writer greg glienna (meet the parents) needs some new material br br the only twist is the deranged boyfriend police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even that opportunity is loosing lots of setting shots of the seattle space needle necessary to disguise the obvious canadian shooting locale some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while selma blair is inert and the short haircut a crime 3m to jason lee, for what \? guess it beats skateboarding ! br br so here's who should see this movie bee gees fans who want to hear two actorssing'islands in thestream'badly people who can't get enough of julia stiles 1 10
