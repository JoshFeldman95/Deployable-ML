i was disappointed the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box having tell that, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty freaky but it just missed for me i kept waiting for that big yessss or boo ! but it never came ab br furthermore the movies was plagued with poor filming of poor special effect thus showing to much of a bad thing and not utilizes atmosphere and viewer utopia to create the horror and suspense try films like meeting 9 or the cubes if your chasing for a weak priced but duly crafted horror movie
