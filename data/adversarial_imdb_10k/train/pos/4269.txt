reading my review of the house that screamed, many may assume thati'm some 14 year old who thinks scream is considered classic horror this is not the case, asi'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life but admittedly,i'm a child of the 80's that grew up on slasher zombie ghost necrophilia, etc types of horror films so i do typically liked horror films that are more graphic and faster paced just like someone who can appreciate different music, painting, or in this case, film but not necessarily adore them i can appreciate why some people may enjoying this sorts of movie i just doingn't brit brit the houses that shrieked is an extraordinarily dreary and tiresome movie about a schooling for capricious girl the overwhelming made padrone of the students rule with an steel side (or whipping in some case) to maintain the girl in lines she ha a juvenile sons who sneaks around and goin on the girl while they showers (in their underwears no less (\? ! \?)), and meanwhile, females are vanishing from the students as they are the victims of a killer who's lurk about the campuses ab ab i can visualizing why the housing that shrieked is frequently regarding to suspiria (which is a centerpiece of a movie in my opinions), in words of the atmospheric of the schooling itself and the interplay between the girl and their caretakers but this movie is thus dreary and uneventful that i could scarcely remain awakei'm all for emphasise and sufferance in horror movie but this movie hold neither for me fortunately, i wasn't expected a whole lots go into this one, since i headquartern't said i was truly unsatisfied the house that shrieked just strengthened the facto that i singly doingn't ordinarily enjoying most terrifying movie very old than from the 70's this isn't a tough and quick rules, but those that i am enjoying certainly seems to are more of the exceptions unquestionably a must peek for horror fanatics who enjoying more underestimated and evocative terrifying movie but as i doingn't truly realize too numerous fans of that sorts of material, i won't absolutely recommending this one 4 10
