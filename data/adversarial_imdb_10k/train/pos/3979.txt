i don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it probably it was the characters who once egomaniacal and were not overriding enough to loving about perhaps it was the messy storyline perhaps it was the fact that rob lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner perhaps it was so at some point in the movie they all break out in song perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s perhaps it was because everything was a garish exaggeration ultimately it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camcorder during a fade out i don't knows what it was that presented me hating it thus, but if it approaches attempting to watching it againi'm not desirous to discovers out
