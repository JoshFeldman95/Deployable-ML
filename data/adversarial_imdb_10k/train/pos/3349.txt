with a titled like this, you heed not to gaze a great horror moviemaking but this was vitally inauspicious, even with low expectations the plot is really insulting and stupid an escaped criminal wears a halloween disguising, so everyone around him thinks he's everybody else this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the aii movie ! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are rather dumb and the story is uninspiring and outright dumb no pending, no excitement and little gore (very cheap) satan's little helper tries to blend horror (\) with comedy and flop dramatically at that it became so boring towards the end, that i actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end i couldn't care whatever happened amanda plummer was great in pulp fiction, but come on that was 13 years ago, and she hasn't done anything decent after that so no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap avoid or be warned
