this would be a watchable hollywood uninspiring if it had a good editing it relies on the typical american thriller plot who is going to outsmart everyone acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises film was completely asphyxiated by blank video and auditory shots and most of it appear like raw film material all in all, if you didn't mind watching a movie that trusts like a schooling film drafts, this is a film to watch i guess that would represented enough to say on this film, everything else could absolutely spoiling the tension that is presumably scant enough
