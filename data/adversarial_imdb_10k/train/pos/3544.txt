by now you should already know about this film, the jessica simpson bomb that pretty considerable went straight to video (limited, lethargic theatrical run) basically, ms simpson's katie travels from a small town in oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman she is stranded, but has one friend (rachel leigh cook, whom i wish we saw more often in film), who lets her stay katie ends up getting a job via two fraud co workers (penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy schlong) who are just using katie to get the president of the firm (larry moeller) fired this is strictly a b movie, its not meant to be profound jessica simpsons is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying the film is watchable in that its not an abomination, but its throwaway silliness in a cameo, penny marshall is funny (a subtle in joke about milwaukee made me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests (don't read too much into this) so, not horrible, but easy to skip your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does again, not good, but not a profound disaster
