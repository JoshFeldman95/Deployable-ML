the reason this is such a bad movie is thereby it is so immeasurably spectacularly written, and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist robert james waller, also writer of bridges of madison county the writer is bad because the plots is perfectly hokey and the dialogue is wooden and implausible a failing couplea blocked america writer and a pretty mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedare swept up by a strong, self directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin, she leaves the impotent partner for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamed face of scott glenn as the killer, not the appealing latinity of giovanna zacarias as luz, and not even the stalwart performance of harvey keitel as the cia specialist assigned to track the killer down a serious waste of time
