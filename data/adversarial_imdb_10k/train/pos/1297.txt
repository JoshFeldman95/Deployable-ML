fans of goremeister herschell gordon lewis would look elsewhere if they are picking up this film for his usual buckets of blood being sloshed about, for there is cherished little in the way of bloodletting in this film pretty, lewis agrees to tempt and tell the bizarre story, relying on bargain basement special effects on a budget which could have probably been doubled if the cast had turned out their pockets for change one times oddly enough, while inexpensive and tremendously rotten acted (especially by mccabe as mitchell), the total outlandishness of the plot keeps attention throughout imagine what this film could have been like with a decent budget ! overall, it strains for champagne tastes on a beer budget
