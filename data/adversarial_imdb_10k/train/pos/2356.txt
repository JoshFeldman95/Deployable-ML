i was truly finding eagerly to this shows delivered the quality of the actor and the truths that the scott brother were incurred spectacularly my hopes were dashed ! yet again we are led to believe that the kgb are a group of untested morons who don't have a clue what they are doing at one point there is a comical scene where 4 kgb agents couldn't treaties one cia agent i grow carsick of these biased, one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the spy game that went on during the cold war i find it laughable that the us is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in ww2 and beyond just like the pathetic u 571, where we are led to believe that the us obtained the enigma machine, again, utterly false br br to its credit, the company is very well filmed and acted the locales are also exceptionally well realised alfred molina puts in a great performance as does keaton (the conflict between them is very well done) i really wanted to like this show and no doubt i will end up watching the other 2 episodes but i really wish that us productions would stop trying to portray their spies, servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet it gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10 10 br br s
