this tv made thriller is all talk, modest action it works hard to set up its convoluted plot, yet the writing is yet confusing the exposition is still cloudy at best by the end, i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning it has a quasi ten little indians scenario, but booms it mid way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killing field overacts here with a gracelessness i've seldom seen from her the early introduces are exemplary, but the writting quickly strays off course and eventually is over the top lots of hysteria, and unbroken thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing) a curious failure from producers aaron spelling leonard goldberg with all this talent, couldn't they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet \?
