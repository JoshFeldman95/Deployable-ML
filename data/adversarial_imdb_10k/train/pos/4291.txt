i actually saw this movie in the theater back in it's original release it was painful to watch peter sellers embarrased himself so badly the story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow, and the ending was ridiculous it was just sad to see how the mighty had fallen i won't say thati'm a huge peter sellers fan, but i get thoroughly enjoy the pink panther series and i felt that he gave a strong performance in being there but this film should never have been made from what i've read, he pursued producing this film against the advice of the people around him fine, but that still doesn't excuse the studio actually releasing the film
