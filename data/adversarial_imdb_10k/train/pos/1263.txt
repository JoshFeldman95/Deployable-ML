the screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the exorcist' but put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged there is no substance whichever in this entire film it had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about extremely irksome, i loved to letting the movie when i enjoyed this but the dumb films tickets were invaluable conversely i enjoys to withstand the sorrowful tortured which thoughts like it were eternally nothing on screens entwined significance back to whatever the character were chatted about br ab they utilizes computer graphic in here that instead of wowing me (as it intended, i hate cgi) just ruined the movie even more some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it's an intelligent film it was what is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy heath ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion \? seems like an uninspired concept oh and there's some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater (movie was originally going to be titled sin eater) lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously, making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was yeah, i know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy br br nothing in the movie was executed right and i forget why i even bothered to see this movie if you want horror films that actually have depth, watch rosemary's baby, the tenant, naked blood, society, cannibal holocaust, pin, exorcist, omen, or any of the romero dead trilogy films nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people, mainstream movie fans think that though (same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like hulk is a cinematic masterpiece) if you want mind numbingly boring horror, watch the order this movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
