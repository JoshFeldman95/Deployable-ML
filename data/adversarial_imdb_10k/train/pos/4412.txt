a authentic displeased from the great visual master ridley scott g i jane reveals the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the navy seals the lessons is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor tells in the cinemas to the lead charactero'neil played by demi moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldn't attaining it perfectly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sink under the sleepy scene and stupid gun fight at the end of the film br br i really can't understand why ridley utilizes so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert \? ! it looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film, black hawk dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are plenty) and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in g i jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing br br this is ridley scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known stilli'm glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of scott's abilities, but they are very few in this film br br a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (blade runner, thelma louise, alien and so on) of this talented director soi'm forced to give g i jane 4 10
