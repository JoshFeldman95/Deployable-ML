this movie was truly not one of mary kate and ashley's best movies i abundantly known't like it, and i was kind of unimpressed in that movies for some causes, it seemed like it was a movies that they put together really quicker in some parts, it got so uninspiring that i had to fast forward it it didn't have any bloopers or any exhilarating parts like their other movies
