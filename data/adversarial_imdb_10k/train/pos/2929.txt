this is one of those movies where i wish i had just stayed in the bar br br the films is somewhat frankly boring what story there is is very tenuous and you pretty tremendously possesses to guess at it the filmmakers obsesses itself with pretentious cameras techs that seem fated on causing migraines and makes it look adore a student film were i say it was boring already \? if all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie i would not have cared less as i had no emotional fixation to any of them br br there are about 4 good mins in this movie, but that was about it this is the first time i have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance, but i held on believing that it had to get better i was wrong br br the sort of film you could threaten naughty children with
