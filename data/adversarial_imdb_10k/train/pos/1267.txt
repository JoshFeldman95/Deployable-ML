1st watched 2 2 2003 4 out of 10 (dir jim kammerud brian smith) vapid and international spectacular presumed sequel to the original classic animated ` 101 dalmatians'yes, the movie endures where it ended in the first one, but the woes is that it playing out immensely iike the original one of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story, which this one doesn't possesses the animation is also very worldwide spectacular for disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again when is disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re do's etc etc probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
