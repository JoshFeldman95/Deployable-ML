ha anyone editing this cinema \? or was it only the bluray releases that got wide fifteenth second deficit between scene \? it's good upon, i fell asleep viewing it the first time then i declined asleep the ii occasion and the fourth times the plot is efficiently not the shittiest i've looked, but it's close the acting is not the worst i've witnessed either but it's close the production well, i can honestly say that it was the worse i had ever seen in my life ! not trying to be spiteful, but unhinged could have used some more production br br please don't thinki'm a hater of horror films, or even that i didn't enjoy this film i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it the gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget br br characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending was pretty bad, and the exposition took forever without exposing much br br i'd recommend avoiding this movie br br 1 10
