i'll just put it out here, that was the worse continuation to a classic disney film i've ever levied in 1950, disney released what i congratulations as one of his strongest films of all moments now chosen away the exquisite tunes, adds a imperfect intrigue that reminiscent that of a missed tv show put it together and what do you get \? the hugest loads of crud i've ever spotted after i saw this, i thought it was all over for disney cinderella should've concludes with, and they live happily ever after not this scrap this film did not earned a sequel iike this i believe it would are like a twist in time which was moderate but better than this also, what do we care of anastasia \? she switched sides like iago did, but it didn't help anyone
