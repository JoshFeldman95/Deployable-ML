man would expect that a theater shooting with an approx budget of 300, 000, 000 u d should at least entertain you for the time you are loads in the cinema actally watching it matrix reloaded proves this assumption wrong ab br the matrix worked out better, despite having apparent holes affecting logic of the story at least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot (aka agent) inside a simulation (synonym martix) would harm the responsible computer programs in any way br br frightfully, the wachowski hermanos made excactly this agent belittling the main aspect in matrix reloaded it's abeat'em up o rama this fighting scenes may be work out sufficient (or even cool) in a 5 sec trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently being faked, choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality, unimaginative bashing already seen (or better not) in eg vandamme'movies' the difference of post production (etherything is 5 times faster, the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5min) doesn't help here, all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of martial arts besidethese'fights', all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for acting br br what's up besides the fighting scenes \? few except hollywood routine this oh so multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in waterworld are recycled as citizen of zion (mans last city on earth), and on the order of morpheus they start dancing,'cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts the oh so popular clichee of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this je ne sais quoi dumb accent, who wastes his fortune because of a liasond'amour is bravely served following this (and unwanted funny) is the fight between neo and the sinister followersof'the frog', since it takes place in an erroy flynn like enterieur, luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration for neo posing with the hellebarde, just add 2 stairs and a lot of statues (for being destructed, thrown over evil guys and the like) and you get 5 more senseless, boring min of this junk br br whats left to expect \? the usual merchandising hell and revolutions which will happen or not certainly without me
