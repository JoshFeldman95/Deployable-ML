br ab i viewed this on the sci se channels it entered on eh after the first one for some causes this movie kept me interested i amn't sais why, quit wondering ab ab spoilers agree it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the productions in the first movie, he had a argument to kill people, but in this sequal, half of the killings attempted shoot were basicly for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences, he captured the co writer due to creative differences, but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast \? no cast, no movie he wanted it to look real when they died \? if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie, use the special effects, man of course like the first one, the captured girl gets away, and stanley ends up getting messed up, and dissapears woooooow (sarcasm) this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake 3 only because i like judd nelson, and he's the only good part about this sequal
