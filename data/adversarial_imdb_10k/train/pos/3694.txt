no laughs whatsoever yes, i watched this totalled train wreck but only so that i wouldn't later wonder if cleese had come to his senses in the latter part (no, he had not) br br this may be historically riveting to you youngsters out there, to see that british humor included black jokes like these, thirty years ago br br what amazes me even more though, is to read the otherreviewers'comments, which concedes this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes if the extensive longest of the comedies that you have watched are even many worst than this one, then i certainly pity your torturous existences br br the humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not so who is this for \? people who enjoy repeated drawn out double takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip backto'77), and other low humor the three stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too they exerted some effort in making jokes work this however is sloughed off schlock i fear that it is the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile next you'll be telling me that tabloid tv is popular \(
