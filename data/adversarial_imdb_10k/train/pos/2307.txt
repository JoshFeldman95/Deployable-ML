this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring, signs and 8 mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very nonsensical and inconsequential and not even zany i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first three but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion, if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies, they just keep getting worse 3 10
