the scripts is so so moronic this in turn, makes theactors'lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to got believes there's repetition of phrases my sweet little god gal and minor variations of that line which poses to mind and it's just sloppy soap opera dialog br br grandest yet, the music is where wrong ! plus, the main bluesy theme is tremendously quaint and acutely wrong for this and it feels overused mostly so the instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this themes never changes, even when the scene's emotional context does br br subsequently, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another br br the music's corny, and it's as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom a low budget 80's canadian sitcom at that and this makes it feel as if we're always on the brink of throwing to a commercial br br this is so miscast, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only one type of ny accent a thick bronx accent i don't know if it's a question of theactors'limited capacity in only knowing one ny accent or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such an glaring anomaly br br in the end, it's the amateur script with it's leaden lines which makes this entire movie blow when any foundation is shaky and unstable, it's impossible to build upon it without it's flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways
