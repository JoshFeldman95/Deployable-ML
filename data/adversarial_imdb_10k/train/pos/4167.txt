i don't advise this movies, because it's imperfect and misleading, this story was inferred to be in tunisian berber territory, this one was shot in the southern tunisian desert, (completetly diverse culture, i know i am from both tunisia and algeria), the other shocking strands was the character of her companion aunt, speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french, ecole ranking ecole english while the character she plays was felt to be of a shaken never left her mountain kind of personage, so iife as a bedouins with that categorize of education i that context is elusive, the most appalling scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the femme repudiee segment which is s pure invention from the writer director, things like that will never happen in a algerian society ever ! ! !
