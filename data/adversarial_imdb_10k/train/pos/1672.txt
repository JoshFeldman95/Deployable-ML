from the fundamental adulation, i expected more from this cinema and from traci kemp the retold just meandered along and don't arise to was a point or a plot and i achieve it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so listless about getting the loss of her virginity over with arguably i am too young to relate (i was four years old in 1976), but i didn't have any difficulties connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or inhabits is beautiful and i wasn't perennial for either of those settings the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience overall, slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, i would say skip this one
