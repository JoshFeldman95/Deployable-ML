i saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release, in a justifiably empty theater believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this one still sticks clearly in my minds as the shittiest movie of all time or at least the shittiest that i would empowered myself to watch br br the acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less br br after the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows but after a while, even that dubious pleasure orientated off and it just got to be really sad
