no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed i wish i could get my time back nice skull face enormous really smiles, bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed scripts i was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end, especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the suppositions sunset eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten, putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer uptake overall, i found most of it pointless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the demise of cast, in a way though, wishing that journey never happened (probably should've been getting laid instead of watching tbs late night, ugh)
