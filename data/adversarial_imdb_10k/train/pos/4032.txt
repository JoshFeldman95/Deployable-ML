this film is too skeleton it's a fairly low budgets film (i expect !) which excuse it somewhat, but the absence of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot steals it too much phillips is quite believable in his feature as a fractured further boy of a allright off familial who's discovering for himself (although his parents is euh satisfactorily, a slight too white), but the stays of the cast is catching at straws whatsoever stage that ha possibilities is disemboweled by extravagant melodrama, and there are ways too diversified sub plot (which is an evident symptom of plot shortcoming they requisite filling) i wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone who isn't either a tough nucleus phillips fans, or who ha totally nothing to doing 4 10
