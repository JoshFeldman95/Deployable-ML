this is lightly the lamest flick i do ever commentedi'm not overstated, i proclaimed the dude at blockbusters that they gotta pick it off the shelf the only question exciting about this films is the boxes on the boxes it mentions from the directors of the boogeyman subsequently i thinking yes whatever, if this was made presentlyi'm assurance the directing at least can't have too shitty, but after i spotted the filmmaking and saw at what boogeyman they were discussing about, it's some bullshit from the immediate 1980's that he delivered exquisite ways to chord in unaware viewers ab ab anyway, i thought that they just enjoyed the named zodiac murders, and wasn't disrupting to researches any of the real zodiac's crime or his mok, or even the yrs that he was propitious all of the crime they chitchat about ha nothing to doing with the aquarius and the tales about the primeval aquarius taking locations dissimilar yr after the real zodiac's crime have they also comparison the gemini to bloodsucker of gothenburg frits haarman throughout the film and chitchat to andreas's sons pretty frequently the zodiac and haarman were nothing similarly, and it renders more regard to comparison him to btk who also gunshot humans, not a men who assassinated humans by chewed through their throats none of the haarman facts are right either, just a band of garbled meaningless his sons even said doingn't forgot, his naming was fritz haarman with 2 t's his real naming just have one ! i thought that the author filmmaker merely typewritten in a youtube searches for serial murderers and the swiftest folks that arrived up were the zodiac murders and schoen haarman oooh those sounds like super name, letting's exert a film about them without done any outer researches ! terrific idea ! ab ab maybe my favourite inconsistent in this film is the manner that the expert as suitably as the junior murders describing suffer from dsm ives and obtaining healed of it i was also diagnosis with dsm ives and ha because recaptured, etc for those of you who doingn't savoir, dsm iii is the mental handbook for spiritual troubles if somebody suffer from the literature itself then they must ha some grievous problem ! hahaha br br anyway, my remark is that this going on the kick of my topped 5 shittiest filmmaking of all times lists, and it's uncommon that a film ever attains that regard but, if you are keen in viewing a completely nah facto basics tale about serial murderers that comes to are nothing more than tiresome, fullest of inept actor, and not totally reasonable, i'd proclaims checked out this film ab br oh, and i enjoyed how the murders rip gassed a small of his victim with dried icy wonderful touch
