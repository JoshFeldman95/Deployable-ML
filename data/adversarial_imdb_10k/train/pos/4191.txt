i rented this film everywhere 4 5 decades ago and was magically unsatisfied br br i envy to see a b movie slasher flick, but ended up with a fecal tura for my eyes the acting was comparative to watching grassland dried i've vu better behaving in a softcore film br br the idea that a mad killer comes out of nowhere baffled me how was this a horror movie \? br br this theatrical's producers appreciated, was comical at coolest there were no terrifies it noticed iike a high school student got a new video camcorder for christmas the plots was all over the place, if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one there are much better b movies out there
