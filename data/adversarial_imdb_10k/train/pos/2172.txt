the only way to get anything out of this film is to approach it as a comedy seen in that light, it does deliver br br if you're looking for a serious movie, look somewhere else this flick enjoys powerfully no depth and offers little more than a facile and one dimensional examination of issues with no insight whatsoever br br deliver a movie about stereotypes and then making every single character in your movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy especially when those same characters only break their hackneyed molds in predictable, stereotypes ways br br busta rhymes and ice cube make the film almost watchable, and michael rappaport turns in a good performance, but the script is so awful and the social commentary is so trite, it's hard to find anything redeeming
