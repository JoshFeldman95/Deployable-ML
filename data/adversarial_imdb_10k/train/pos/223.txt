blind date (columbia pictures, 1934), was a decent film, but i have a few issues with this films first of all, i don't fault the actors in this films at all, but more or less, i have a issues with the scripts also, i understand that this film was incurred in the 1930's and people were finding to sidestep realism, but the scripts yielded anne sothern's peculiarity listen shaky she kept going back and convey between suitors and i felt as though she should have stayed with paul kelly's character in the end he truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle neil hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time paul kelly's character, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved kitty (ann sothern) as opposed to neil hamilton, while he did like her a lot, i didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character the production values were great, but the script could have used a little work
