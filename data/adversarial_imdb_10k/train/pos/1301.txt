i was anticipation to love this moviemaking film noir, serial killer, dark irony i was perplexed by many choice the character made (ooh, i knowed they're creepy looking, but letting's hooks up for a traversed peoples route trip anyway !), noticed the pacing to be glacial, and the emphasis on moody lighting to take the place of original thought by the director and cinematographer br br thinking about it now, this would have been a much better movie if someone had just run the script through the common sense o meter (1992 model) before starting to film
