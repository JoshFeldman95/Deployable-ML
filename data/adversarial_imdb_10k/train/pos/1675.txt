tatie danielle is all about a ghastly old hag who torments her loving and oblivious family out of sheer spite there's a bit of subtext that might be about france's colonial past but it's mostly just danielle doing the sorts of things (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man picking up his teeth with broken fingers sadly, that doesn't happen here it looks exemplary and the acting is allright and there's nothing openly wrong with the notion but it's just why arrogant god, makes this film love itself pity it isn't intimately as artful or as comedic as it cru it is the only impetus in the showing contrite, film happens from danielle securing classier and nastiest, and the only shocked happens from stared the eternally inconclusive forms she doing this that's true just like in a sitcoms, which is what this is, with theadded'bonus'of delusion of magnificence and a 110 min run minute
