this was the roughest yule film i ever saw i took my three meager youth to viewing this it was the truest, most dismal plots family had no resources, mom loses her job, father gets killed in the bank, bank robber hurts family car with both kids in the back and after high speed chase, drives off the bridge and drowns them in the river mums is left all alone no wonder her christmas spririt is gone christmas angels don't rescue children that es engulfed, and santa does not bring back dead fathers ! i thought this was the worst messages to sends child finest to tell them that there is no claus than display them a film like this ! !
