there are some great metaphysical points what is the aimed of resides \? what happens when we deceased \? and why been they introduces movies this rotten \? \? \? the premise is absurd thre behaved is one dimensional the extraordinary effects are overdone and the films is one timeless gun battle among some of the lousiest shots hollywood ever produced but then, if they had been ok shots, everybody would haya been perish in the first three moments and there would represent no films too bad it didn't happen that ways tempted to turning it off several times, i stuck with it to see just how horrid it could get glad i did because (spoiler \?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario it is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive in in off season apart from the general awfulness of the film, i worry deeply about its impact on young audiences the americans crank out crap like this and then wonder why events like columbine happen this is truly banal cinema on a brobdingnagian scale !
