poor performances by sinatra, martin and hyer grossly underdeveloped assists character tiring talky with no real plot interrupt leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more loose ends than you could tie up in three sequels (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters) maclaine is the only realistic wares that penultimate sequence in which the chicago hood searches for the sinatra character is ridiculous the music in that sequence also is imperfect and in the final scene when martin's character removes his hat for the woman he called a pig, almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen
