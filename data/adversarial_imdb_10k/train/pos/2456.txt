well where do i begin my story \? \? i became to this movie tonight with a few friendships not knowing more than the actors that were in it, and that it was presumed to pose a horror films ab br well i figured out within the first 20 moments, what a infirm decision i had made going out seeing this movie the plot was crap, and so was the scripts the lines were heinous to the respect that people in the audience were laughing hysterically ab ab the cast couldn't have been more plastic watching even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker like they dragged on for no particular reason very poor editing br br all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money boo
