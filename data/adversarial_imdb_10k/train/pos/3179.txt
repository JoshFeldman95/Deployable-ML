i contemplation cliffs robertson certainly was one of our finest actors he has a half dozen classics to his credit he is magnificent here as the heavy, but the direction is so bad and the pacing so grueling, it never gets off the mark the story initiates off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hung herself still he mugs well and is things along the death knell is twofold first of all, if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the movie add to that, robertson's character sitting up in bed in the blue light, looking confused, that might add another chunk i agree with those that said a half hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent, though insignificant film the biggest weakness is just a convoluted plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questionsi'm not putting in spoilers, but when it ends, don't think too much i can come up with ten what ifs without raising a sweat it would have been better if it had remained a ghost story
