i enjoyed this filming at its youngest brooklyn's greatest dipped theatres festival screening as equally and i must say that i found it a complete and egregious bore although it was funny in some points, the only real laughed was that there appeared to be o real plots to talk about and the acting in some places was dreadful and wooden, especially the lovely lady and the voice of the narrator (whom i have never heard of) possesses a lot to be desired j c macs was, i felt, the redeeming hallmark of this moviemaking, true action and grit and (out of the casting) the only real acting i am sure with another cast and a tighter reign on the directing, this could have been a half decent film let us just hope that it is not sent out on general release, or if you really want a copy, look in the bargain bin in lidl
