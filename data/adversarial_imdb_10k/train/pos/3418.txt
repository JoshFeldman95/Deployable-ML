beautifully photographed and ably acted, generally, but the writting is very slipshod there are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no happier in the watching the fact that the young lover ha a twin brother, for instance, is yet contrived that i groaned out loud and the emotion light bulb connection seems gimmicky, too br br i don't know, though if you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic images, this is a pretty good movie no major effort on the part of the viewer required but italian film, especially italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this
