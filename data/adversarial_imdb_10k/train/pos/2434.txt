i like chris rock, but i feel he is blew in this film the idea of remaking heaven can wait is fine, but the films followed the intrigue of that turkeys too closely when eddie murphy recreated doktor doolittle and the nutty professor, he ri did them totally also they became murphy films vehicles, not just tepid remakes that's why they were successful if chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film the few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine so he might as well have done a concert film it also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly so why does hollywood keep making junk like this \? because people go to see it because they like chris rock so give chris a decent script and give us better movies ! don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place !
