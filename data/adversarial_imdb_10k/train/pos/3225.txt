i was interested in the topic, and only fans of drew witherspoon's choreography on david letterman's desk will find anything vaguely exciting in it ok, she shows some breast (or maybe a body double does) the plots is decreased to bits and the acting is outrageous neither lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film produces nowhere don't wreckage your occasion see donnie darko instead if you envy a creepy drew barrymore film, and if you want to see another, go this and see darko again br br the treatment of the doppelganger legend is absolutely penal as well refer to charleswilliams'novel descent into hell for something worth considering instead this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at blockbuster br br what makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy \? give me a break
