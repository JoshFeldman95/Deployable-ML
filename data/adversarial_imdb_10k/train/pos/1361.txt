was this movie stupid \? yup did this movie depth \? nope character development \? nope plot twists \? nope this was simply a movie about a highly fictionalized springer show it shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on tv molly hagan does a great job as jaime pressly's mom aime is well gorgeous ! this flick wasn't so considerable made to be a breakthrough movie, acutely, it was crafted to life in a trailer park (i live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie) where everyone sleeps with everyone else, all the girls get pregnant by different guys, and all the guys drive rustedout'66 ford pickups (exaggeration, of course, but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park) some people over analyze movies (case in point star trek freaks) i watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene (read the goofs bit about connie's shirt could it have been better \? sure but it was funny as hell
