blue baboon (1987)or'invasion of thebodysuckers'as it's known here in the uk was a pretty annoy horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant ! ! ! ! the man gets rushed to hospital, where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the bloodbath ! ! despite steve railsback and johns vernon being in the movie, i detected it to be uninspiring, with a stable predictable backstory, un spectacular characters, cheap special effects and scarcity of precautions ! ! ! ! horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me ! ! ! i give this movie 2 10
