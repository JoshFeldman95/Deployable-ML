this gotta come a great film gwyneth streep and grey nicholson co starring as three diem playwright mich nichols aiming uhhhh uh it's somber dull dull ! nonsense and predictable ! slow and unfocused ! br br it's a cookiecutter'boy meets girl, boy marries girl, boy has affair, girl leaves boy'story now belive an original concept ! after squirming through two days (was it only two \? it felt like six) i wasn't sure whether it was a comedy, a romance, a tragedy or a soap opera it was done in 1986i'm sure all of us did things sixteen years ago that we rather would forget i hope the damage to the reputations of streep et al is beginning to heal and that the emulsion on the master is beginning to fade it's not that it's such a bad picture it's just that it's such an un good one
