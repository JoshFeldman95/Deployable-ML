couldn't receive me incorrect, the film is delightful, the shots are astonishing, and the contents is terrific however, it was a large disappoints and i actually left rather angry at what disney had done br br bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more it was subtle it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death there was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain it was balanced br br disney's edit of earth is none of this they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about they made it dramatic they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us they made predators evil they made walruses evil they showed every encounter as negative it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive br br i am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk br br that's another thing, i went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality it looked better on my tv at home br br if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the bbc's planet earth series it is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have blu ray) better picture quality
