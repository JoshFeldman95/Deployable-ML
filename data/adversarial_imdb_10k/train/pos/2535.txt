historically accurate \? hmm perhaps if you squint, and light falls upon the subject just therefore but core accuracy is no compensation for a woeful, patchy and conflicting intrigue, poring of postcard dialog and an unsatisfying conclusion the principal personality are merely characterizations shame stereotypes that range fromthe'enigmatic andnoble'american indians through to the'stuffy butsadistic'british officers a sorrowful and unworthy delivery of a suspenseful period in american history i want my money back
