this is one of those film that i could only sessions through once charlotte henry is ok in fact, all the actors were ok the problem was in the script, the dialogue, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effect granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked share of the problems is that actors like roberts maxine, gary coop, w iii fields and cary gives are not recognisable (there face cried for a recognizing that was not forthcoming) the moviemaking just clumped along with no unanimity tremendously of lewis carrols psychotropic, irreverent and continuity are misses what a pity ! it's such a grand literature i would recommending disney's 1951 versions
