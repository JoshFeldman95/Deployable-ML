while i have never been a fan of the original scooby doo (due to its horrid productions assessing), it appears like shakespeare compared to this velvet of friggin provided to us by hanna barbera ! without a doubt, scrappy doo is about the most maddening and shocking characters created for children (and this includes the teletubbies as well as tommy the tapeworm) whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the scooby doo characters with it \? ! whoever it is deserves to perished or watch this show (i think death is preferable) the bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny, annoying and grates on the nerves and this is only in the better episodes ! ! after many years, it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess ! i can see why in the live action scooby doo movie they made the villain scrappy doo since practically everyone hates him !
