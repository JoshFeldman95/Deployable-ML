after watching the first 20mn of blanche (sorry i couldn't take more of it), i have now confirmed she does not br br basically, this movie is an belittling to the real french actors attendees in this comical cut of bullshit it starts from a concept successfully used in french comedies (ii heures moins nova quart previous freaking christ, el folie des grandeurs,) a historical cinema with anachronic tone dialogues this can delivers brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a finesse of direction avoiding the dreaded heavy comedy stigma ab ab spectacularly, the horsey faced lou doillon ruins everything and blanche, instead of a comedy, just turns into an horror movie horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as decaune, zem or rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy prissy farce
