it's a ghost story it's a cannibals story it's a revenge story it's a very unjustly done film with a lot of violence i suppose it follows stingy along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen it has the usual isolated place, the cocky campers, heading off to the wilderness granted, there are some pretty intense scenes it's just conversely bleak inauspicious editing and the whole works there are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastepaperi'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by it also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife a friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence i fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution three is no cleverness here, no tongue in cheek, only a sad waste of time lots of blood little plot
