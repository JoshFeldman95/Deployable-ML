i am a overwhelming vents of sci ter scene alike, when i met this flick in the epg, i believes i was in for a pleasant night what a dismay ! such a tenuous screens of special effects i could not imagine in 1980, but in 2005 \? come on, why would you do special effect of an helicopter flying in the deserts when you can film a real one for a much lower price (i guess) \? and those killer muppets well, i could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage you can expect to have a low budget on a movie, but i don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget as for the star of the movie (i use a lot of quotes tonight), lou diamond philips, the guy is not even remotely an actor maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies all in all, an awful movie maybe i am in a bad mood tonight then again, maybe not a sincere 1 out of 10
