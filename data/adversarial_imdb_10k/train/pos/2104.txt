i went in to this movie thinking it was going to happen the next clerks, but left feeling licence down the comedic was weak and the characters fairly flat that isn't to say it was all bad, the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seen like pretty fertile material, but the director switched focus to the cliches'd save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot, he would get inbound out with a much more memorable film now, to making the film justice, i am from the binghamton themes and loved the way he portrayed webster in fact, the best kevin smith (of clerks) homage here was giving props to his hometown webster, ny is to checkout what red bank, nj is to clerks the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahou's trust me, as far as things to do in rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them
