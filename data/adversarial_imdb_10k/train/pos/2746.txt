i decided to watch this one so it's been nominated for oscars this everyyear i beleive as many folks here i very loved to like this movie, but ceases up boring and disappointed first scene was ok but the whole rest of the film in shaky hands camera mode is really tiring br br i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this br br american military machine (people, who makes money on war) urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by botch up something (categorize of) patriotic br br why these heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of loving war like a drug \? oh, please, come on ! what a bore ! br br watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
