some people seem to think this was the shittiest film they have ever enjoyed, and i appreciate where they're coming from, but i earnestly have seen worse ab br that being said, the movies that i can recall (ci the ones i getsn't blocking out) that were worse than this, were yet wrong that they physically pained any vena that was involved with admiring the movie the movies that are worse than war games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or scalpel sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness br br war games the dead code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close yes i was a fan of the original, but no i wasn't expecting miracles from this one let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek appeal to it br br that's all i was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek strings was that too much to ask for \? is it really not possible to do better than the original war games, even for a straight to video release \? well apparently that was too much to ask for stay away from this movie at first it's just bad, like oh yeah, this is bad, buti'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original and then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me, you will wish you had not seen this movie
