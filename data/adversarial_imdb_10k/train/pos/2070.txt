(noting i adored the iconic black coaching like it effected up for the completely white squad and all theblack'giants'players) ab ab 2 the uncritical adulation by everyone evangelical about this film can i got a peers men to said that it was inclement behaving, inclement filmed, inclement write and in terse bad compare to other films if we were to comparison this to another footballs film, would it ha the same charisma and energies \? brit ab 3 the medium bakes christendom which was showed effected even fewer sensing to me than the impractical ending if christendom is about merely readings a small scriptures and pray to commence a finishes lives changes, then doingn't astonished when no one volition heed to what christianity ha to said we wanna to selling jesus as a curing all he wouldn't needs sells and he wouldn't needs to are attaching to such fanciful lifestyle no astonishment everyone deems christendom to are counter cognitive with this surreal presentations br ab i recognise this movie may are motivational to a scant humans to most, it hope not are it will not confer a actual pictures of struggles and hearted tensions most significantly to me, it is not christian by any approaches or stretching it got values but it tumbles few asa'pull yourself up by thebootstraps'message as superficial as favorable thoughts if you inhabit beside humans who conflicts and or those in terzi worlds lifestyles situation, this film hope are empty as most chapels are nowadays in their religions
