of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity and ir edit it on vhs for a faculties cable piping many years thereafter, i tried to figure out what sufficiently went wrong what seem to has happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for normal theatrical viewing how much longer \? to fill in all the gaps in the plot as we have it would requires about two more hour of narrative and qualities advances vitally given the fact that the movie we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously br br that's startling what could the halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here \? their previous film, white zombie, was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early universal studios monster films (the mummy, dracula, etc), and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in north america would know from popular magazines br br revolt of the zombies, to the contrary, appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war this would not only explain the opening, and the change of dean jagger's character into a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film, besides stand around, look frightening, and wait for orders they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films br br i am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics but i think a film ought to be entertaining first, and only later, maybe, educational and definitely a film about zombies ought to be about zombies br br truly one of the most bizarre films in hollywood history, but not one i can recommend, even for historic value
