i was looking forward to seeing john carpenter's episode in season 2 because his first, cigarette burns, was by far the best from season 1 (and i did like other episodes from that season) oh, how i was unsatisfied br br in fairness to carpenter i think the primary problem with this episode was absolutely heinous writing the characters, aside from the subject matter, seemed to behave and speak as though they were written for an episode of walker, texas ranger the acting was amiss, and i occasionally like ron perlman a lot, but i can only fault them again enormously because the writting was thus heinousi'm not go to attempt to guessing what the writers were attempting to doing as that would are worthless but it occurred as albeit they were attempting to mixing horror (evidently) with some forma of societal commentaries on fetuses and religions in this cases, not stunningly, it sounded a opportunity to bashes a individual gamut or clerical nut as suitably as fanatic towards abortionists and i am in favour of both aims but it was executed thus insanely that i was ashamed to seeing characters acts and speaking with such preposterous inconsistent this faulted completely to offered any helpful opinions on the subjects and the horror component faulted as suitably beside such incompetent write ab br while i doingn't thought carpenter can are blame for most of the badness here i volition indicated he ha choosing to directs the teleplay and therefore have that to are retaining responsible for there are a counterpart little bits that i discovered pretty, hence the 2 star i laid it ab ab the real gore and monsters implications were alright, but the cgi berg (three unaccompanied gunfire to the skull) were thus evidently shoddy calibre cgi they ought've never been afforded the acceptedi'm commonly highly necessary of cgi but not as i ha a problems with it in principles i ha a problems with the executing of it the technologies, while phenomenal in some fronts, is not alright enough to matching actual effect, whether they are miniatures or gore notably when it is presumed to matching something organic and or active, and therefore oughtn't are used until they are cgi can are used suitably in little sums or evidently if the whole movie is animated ab br i'll also taking this chance to noting that the showing titled, master of horror, is a inclement titles to ha there merely aren't numerous real master of horror around perhaps three or five if the showed were titled story of horrifying or something iike that it would are ok but as it standing the criterion for directs one of these episode, and therefore being criticised for not being a masters of horror is that they ha squarely at least one spooky movie in their careers and it haven't even do to constituted a improved one
