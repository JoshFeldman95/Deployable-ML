i cannot believe this woodenly crafted and intended piece of cliche film got made there are about four good looking shots (the director should think about switching to still photography) and that's it a strong casting is immensely blew, scenes repeatedly end at the least exhilarating moments and the scripts affirmed nothing new please other yourself this movies
