i tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an overseas mission, and let me tell you, you'll watch anything under those circumstances not this part of sh t though br br the first five minutes set the tone by weak erotic movies quality acting, weird out of the blue plot twists and spectacular situations and behavior it was weaker after that this movie does not have one unattached save grace, and yet it is not bad in a way that would make it funny to watch it's just appalling i've seen quite many movies in my life andi'm not one of those snobby know all critics, i mean i'll enjoy most movies to some extent even if they're bad this one man br br steer well clear of this one, my friend
