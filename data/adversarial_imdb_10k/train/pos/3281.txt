duly the motivator for watch it in the theatrical was that it was a snuck previews, else i would never possessed commented this devastating youth slasher flick i mean hasn't we enjoys enough of this yet \? scream and panic movie at least did not take them self serious ! the plot bumps, and the acting is the shittiest i've seen (only godzilla can compares, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one) br br there is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not (and you don't care) the only of them i knew in advance was denise, and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie br br stay as far away from this movie as possible (2 10)
