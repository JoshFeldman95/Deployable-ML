i've seen better production quality on youtube ! i pity the actors, as the writing was heinous and the direction shocking, not sure how they could get the lines out i really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no occasion how good they were the character were not develop at all, and there was no exact sameness in the plot which just seemed to budge nowhere much it's a shame genuinely, as the scenario for the film was exemplary and with better fertile qualities, guided and scenarios it could was been a opportune movie it certainly was not a comedy, unless you giggling out loud at the dubbing which was amateurish, even the english actors sounded weird
