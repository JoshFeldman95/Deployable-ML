scary movie 2 was a mortuary unsatisfied simply referencing movies, like mission impossible 2 does not lead to comedy the movie opens successfully enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent consume of james woods ands andy richter the film plummets from there unfortunately the acting is outrageous tori spelling looks and acts completely out of place the movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly lent paced some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned tony cruise movie, cant comedy to anyone in my cinema the film, thankfully, poses shriek to a end at 83 moments in a shockingly unfunny ending (i say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) i dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers overall, a very poorly done movie
