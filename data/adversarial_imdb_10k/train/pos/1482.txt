a shame that even a talented director, desplechin, could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly adept actress, phoenix, esther khan shortcoming the substance to communicates a enormously concise and unambiguous plots in an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor's plight, the performance and presentation is too manmade and unjustly executed to draw any selfless from the viewer in an overly long running time, the redundancy of esther's struggle is too melodramatic to come effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a devastating display the content is incoherent and gratuitous as phoenix struggles to carry out desplechin's instruction, just as esther is supposedly trying to do the same never feeling a convincing victory over esther's pain, we never feel a victory in phoenix's talent
