i was very unimpressed with cinderella 2 and jungle book 2, but this is possibly worse than both titles first of all, i didn't like the animation, very saturday yo cartoon, only worse in some imaging i adored some of the characters, namely thunderbolt and patch, but the other characters, like cruella were tenuous cruella was truly villainous in the prime, but she unaccounted her qualities in the sequel what she said was nothing at all to writting home about and her animate was kind of ugly also her performer companions lars was a humour to viens heartfelt with you, and roger seemed to ha quit smoking overnight the voice talents were very good though especially barry bostwick as thunderbolt, with the exception of jodi benson, the accent ruined it for me there were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed bloated for me, and highly suggestive of an extended tv episode all in all, a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s disney movies along with jungle book sorry, i can only give this a 3 10, it just wasn't my cup of tea bethany cox
