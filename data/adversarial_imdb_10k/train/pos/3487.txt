i was mad anyone made this movie i was even more angry i lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this i could have had a wax job and been more entertained at least cherri makes me laugh before it hurts i was a bit confused at first but then i caught on and realized what was going on by this time the film was midway way through, and oh i am a procrastinator but i consistently want to see things through until the end so i stuck it out i seen it all not only are the performers not as attractive as in cruel intentions, they just aren't persuaded i've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie if you like bad movies with bad acting watch this
