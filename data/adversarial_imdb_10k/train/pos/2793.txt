i have seen most, if not all of the laurel hardy classic films i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who fashioned both laurel hardy, however fails comically for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayal in the 90's setting some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also ignore terrifically to future tightly to the customary installments this theatrical could enormously well be the shittiest movies i enjoys ever enjoyed and ought are pull off the shelves and lock remotely eternally the actual laurel hardy are slovenly spins in their tombs at such a inclement impersonation
