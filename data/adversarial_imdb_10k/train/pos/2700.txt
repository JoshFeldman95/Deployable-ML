btk killer, green river killer, zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap br br i've never seen a ulli lommel film but i was so mesmerised on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful like the movies i said in the beginning don't even equality a six when added together ! after reading the comments i was curious to see how lousy this guy really is he is the worst out there br br the credits wouldn't end as the cruddy movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly spectacularly dubbed in the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots the editing is easily the worst this movie made no sense and i unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and i was only 45 minutes in the movie i couldn't take it anymore i wasted 45 minutes of my life br br don't watch this crap !
