from the booting of the moviemaking i grabbed a vibe like its a moviemaking about another jason's from friday the 13th and it is disagree that the movies opens interesting but as the times goes by its just a nonsensical cinema about muted, supernatural, silent serial homicidal i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound, not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and slaying people like he used toi'm tired of it for me it's all over the same thing br br in another words unreal too grands mistakes and confusing information br br well scene with tide up chick looked impressive but just at first time for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars
