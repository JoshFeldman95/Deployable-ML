i thought before departure with these movie that it may become a best one, but when i started with it i unearthed it truely abysmal they said moviemaking is being handed in afghani but i think 95 of the movie is shot in india you can vista indian filed cars you can expect anders alcoholism bisleri (an native waters trademark), hindu write on the freeways, you can also witnessing shrines in afghani hahah its really funny and many more stuff which proving its not shot in afghanistan i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie pure time waste i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don't watch this waste of time
