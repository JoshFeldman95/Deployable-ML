i went to the movies, tosee'beatstreet' it wasn't bad, it waskinda'neat'krushgroove'was a flick, that i didn't mind but when it cameto'rappin', i drew the line word to your mother br br want me to stop \? br br that's just a small sample of the stupa fly style ofrhymin'on display in this wastage of panorama and location permits this movie is highly wacky (thats 80s speak for just f cking awful) as an emcee, mario van peebles is one hell of an actor and as an actor, mario van peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder br br any film calling itselfrappin' had better deliver at that genre's highest standard of the time so why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles, even back in the day when standards were so knee high to webster low \? because this rap is weak so weak that not even b e t or comedy central will touch it with a 10 foot gold rope chain br br blondie's rapture is def poetry next to this bit of dr suess in the hood so don't be a boobie, avoid this movie ! br br
