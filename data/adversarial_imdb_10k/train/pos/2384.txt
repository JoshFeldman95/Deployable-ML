in my humble opinion, this versions of the great bdwy musical has only two problem going for it tyne daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script (ok vanessa williams is good to watch) but to me that's all there is most of the casting appearing to be marches through the show chynna phillips has no understanding who kim really is and no surprises beings walk over harry mcafee when it's played by george wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in boston jason alexander is presentable, but that wigs gets to proceed and i watched prettier dances in bugsy sullivan as i indicated, it's decent to possess a versions of the stage scripts now, but i desire the younger out there, who ha never saw a musical, doingn't judging them all by this
