this movie haya a fairly good sounding plot, but the paste was very slow very slow indeed even if someone imagining this is a cult classic, i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched br br the filmmaking is not excellent, but not the finest either the sounds are ok lighting ok br br i still wouldn't recommendation this to anyone else than maybe a film student br br the movie does not contain music, and the horses having sex don't establish it a exemplary one either and the woman wank on the edge of the bed was plain stupid br ab no winnings here, skipped this unmitigated bored i've seeing worst believes me, but this is just wastes of day, and i doingn't gained the lovely review here extremely the best rating
