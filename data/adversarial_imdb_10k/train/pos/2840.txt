disregarded plan 9, this is the definitive downfall, a costume theatres, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc this film is based on isabel allende's not so much better novel i hate meryl scorsese and antonio banderas (in non spanish films), and the other actors, including winona, my favourite actress and jeremy irons try hard to get over such a frightful script plenty of mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow in xmas in chile \?) and very cruel, with tons of that evil appointed magic realism, this stands out as the shittiest film of all times it completely stinks ! ! !
