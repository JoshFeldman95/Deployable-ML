i've just watched fingersmith, and i'm fascinated to embrace the 8 10 average rankings for the show ab br not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it appear character development was lightly applied br ab the actors were ample, but in the treat of seeking to forge twists and turns, their character are rendered entirely one dimensional once this arrival, the stories really falls flat and achieves arduous br br and just in occasion anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered dwelling in the most banal term at the end of the flick br br the completes scenes is disappointed and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along !, must have been out for the evening br br two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it
