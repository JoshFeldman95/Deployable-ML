i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience, and the only matter which obligated me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post screening survey i felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot independently, it was included of (too) plenty sub plots competitor for screen schedules as a result, there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment what the director and producer amiss to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters in fact any one sub plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film (the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub plots and characters) simply put, the hungry bachelors club's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired
