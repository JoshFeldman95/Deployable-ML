ah yes, the vs series, mvc2 being the pinnacle it's been said before, this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job, unfortunately the gameplay half did don't get me wrong, this is enjoyable, but you achieves antsy of mashing buttons as for the intrigue succinct, ahahahahahaaaaa there is no plot beat that guy at the ceasing and win ! eh, who plays this by their self anyway \?
