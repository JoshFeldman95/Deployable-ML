i saw this movie at a'sneakpreview'and i must honestly confess that i don't like films with meryl streep that much this picture was the grandest half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film i couldnt blame them, if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear
