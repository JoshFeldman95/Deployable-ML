i happening to remain the directors's nephew it's brought me aging to becoming my hand on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the shittiest films of all time my uncle doesn't even have a copy of it anymore (i asked)i'm looking forward to bringing him a copy br br currently the film's mean rating is 1 9 10 as far as i can tell, that should put it somewhere in the mid 30s in the imdb bottom 100, however with only 206 votes, it hasn't yet entered ab ab it's sad that the film doesn't even get the respect of a bottom 100 title br br anyhow,i'm giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts best worst gift ever \?
