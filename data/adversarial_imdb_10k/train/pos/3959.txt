i don't thinki'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the lamest movie i've ever seen i've been working on a list of my favorite war movies the grandest today, to hell and back, bridge on the river kwai, (all black and white) which all has good plots, rich characters and great acting i've seen better dialog and acting in student written high school one act makes the plot, however isn't a bad premise just poorly implemented it's kind of like a traffic accident, though, i couldn't seem to turn it off ! a movie doesn't need big money or great sets i e twelve angry men and lifeboat to be good so budget is no excuse what were they thinking \?
