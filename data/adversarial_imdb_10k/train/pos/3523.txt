kind of hard to devine that the flick from this literature could succeed in sprinkle its awfulness ! the plots is well engineered and sublime cranking with throws a ton of guilt on a restrained child to spare her suffer ! then we possesses the collusive behaviours of at least eight and maybe more people (including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces a tremendously dirty and coo coo mother, aided, emboldened and supported by a politically correct group of friends ! moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all the movie i kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious mythological allegory my advice is to skip this one oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat \? the best part of this movie is the scenery
