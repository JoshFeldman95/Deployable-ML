spoiler notice ab br first of all i rated this flick 2 out of 10 ab br the concept is good, but there are too plenty nonsensical error in the moviemaking, fault to brings it the psyching drama that it chance have been first of all she never fights alone after an outset very surreal doubt from her mothers (which is not plausible when the mothers illustrates to get so supportive and compassion further in the movie) the raping wounded is not alone ab br she is also unbelievably naive always soaking into the crew's strange trapping ab ab her friends are superbly filthy ab br the thing that i find most unbelievably is that ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon ethan is very much the leader of the crew (hey, they even say so) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk, but when ethan changes his opinion he just doesn't manage to convince even one single person in the crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong everyone just simply hates him why \? \? the movie provides no explanation how did he ever become the leader \? br br a funny note is that my girlfriend thought i was watching beverly hills when she came in two actors from the same successful tv series a cheap way to get viewers \?
