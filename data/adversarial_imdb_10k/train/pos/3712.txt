i will debut this off by saying i couldn't gets all the ways through it i picked it up on a rainy day from wal like the rest of the reviewers on this site i figured there wasn't any way i would regret my purchase was i wrong or what \? seriously now, who approved this project \? they need to be requiring to watch this movies over and over until the end of life that's the only readjustment punishment i can think of for releasing something this unfavourable the shooting reminds me of the movies i used to make for class projects on a big old vhs cam the acting isnt much better i think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos yay, who cares shecky moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser that's about as much of the plot as i understood br br overall it's the worst movie i've ever seen i own it on dvd and have given it to many co workers to watch each comes back and laughs and says wow i didnt think i'd ever say i shut off an adam sandler movie 15 minutes in br br my response is always well now you can br br
