no, this is nothing about that fairy tale with the pumpkin coach, fairy fairy and the glass slippers, but if i were to elaborate, i would have to spoil it for you, which i won't but don't let curiosity get the better of you, as this movie is not outstanding it's one of those movies that start off promisingly, before risked its audiences with affordable scare stratagem and an counterintuitive backstory and that's real horror br br yoon hee (to ji won) and hyun soo (shin se kyeong) are your ideal mama and girl one's a fruitful plastics surgeons, while the other your natured, dutiful, and gorgeous teenaged girl their relationships is like side in gloves, thus narrowly you'd thought of them more as sibling somewhat than parents kid but aspects starting to going awry (doesn't they perpetually) when hyung suu's buddies, whom yun ji did operate on, starting to going berserk br ab maybe it's a warns to audience, and for those koreans woman who doingn't wallop an eyeball when go under the stab, if news reporting are to are felt the only genuinely frightening times are those scene in plastic surgeries, albeit somehow, i thoughts kim ki dos's times indeed possess more gore when feature and describe what disappears on during the surgeries itself ab ab it's a story of three portions, the fists being an try to shocked audience with customary frighten machinations, which, i admitted, has got to me now and then however, the second halved degenerate the film into thoughtless nonsense gigantic melodramatics, and was pretty contrived into its pushing its concept down your throats some aspects commence not to put sense, and while tries are perpetually supplied to explaining, you presumably wouldn't purchasing it, not that horror filmmaking are rational to commence with br ab the lead are all gorgeous, and there is a separate lacking of male involvements besides the insignificant policeman roles but ahoy,i'm not griping, albeit the storyline could ha been refinements immensely i'd recommending you to watching this, only if you're a admirer of lackluster korean terrifying, on divx monitored out for those confronting off hsi times !
