spoilers if such a thing is possible as a rabid robin williams fan, i felt it necessary to buy this movies as first on screen appearance wow i could not imagine a more mind numbing movie essentially, the theatres takes one bad joke after another that your uncle artie would apprised you after dinner and dramatizes them robin williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit br bri'm all for bawdy irreverent, but this humor wasn't pleasantly vulgar, or ribald it was just mind numbing there are no redeeming qualities to this film, other than robin williams fanatics, like me, who simply have to own every piece of film
