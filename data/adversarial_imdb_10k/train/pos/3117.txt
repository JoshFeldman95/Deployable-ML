iwatched'envy'two nights recently, on dvd, at a friends house the premise of this film is quite promising, jack black and ben stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential, but it profoundly faulted to delivers i watched it with about five friends and no one laughed for the comprehensive film the jokes (which are few and far between) are not humorous in any way the story line is crap, and they never answer the question where does the sh t go \? of course the answer to that is no one cares this film lacked any triage of hilarity valuing, and as a few other users have saying the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is christopher walken as the j man none of the characters are developed, the plots so thin it's nearly transparent and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny \? \?
