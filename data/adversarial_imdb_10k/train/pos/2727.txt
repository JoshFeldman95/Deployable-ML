i see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark the main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it the camera work, ie lighting and exposer is kind of amateurs which i could forgive if the direction was more fluent but it wasn't the noise was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well i see could see this director accomplished a humble piece better in the future so not a full right off but doesn't expect a dv movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything, keep your expectations few and you'll get more out of it at least it was only an hours and a middle uhh yes and other than the culminate the acting was quite lousy if you asks me buti'm a film snobs thus taking that for what that's value
