unless the title is felt to be some kind of spoiler for the wife's transformation (the fiends ! ruins it for us) anycase, if this films wasn't made for tv, it cannot have been, it's so remarkably low budget, underscripted, underacted, and hits every 70's cliches except disco nobody is likable, and you could reckless what happens to anyone in this one tremendously forgetable except for the bad, inauspicious performances
