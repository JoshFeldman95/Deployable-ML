did anyone else notice whenever they are in the vehicle each days the cameras takes a new angle they exchanged highways like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks, next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider, next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes i can understand a low budget but that was just unruly filmmakers cooperate br br i also reading the other review and disagree that it was a rotten film i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie if, however, you find his works not comedic then i would praises staying outward from this one
