they received such eventual for this movie and they supremely decreases flat in the first cruel intentions, we are left please what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do there is almost no character development whatsoever in this prequel it's definitively a very sad story but this film did nothing for me it was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f words and the end makes absolutely no vena and doesn't explain anything the write was just heinous another thing that troubled me was that they used at lease 3 of the exact same line that were in the original such as down boy, or the kissing scene, and a few others i can't remember i was not impressed at all by robin's acting, but amy did a great job that's about the only thing that reconciled this movie
