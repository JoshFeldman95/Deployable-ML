i am a overwhelming michel madsen fans, why needless to say, i bought this movie without even incur it or anything this films was accordingly heinous, i didn't even take it back to the store, i wouldn't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poisons, i just threw it in the trash, never mind the cash, it was worth the price to be able to throw it away the acting wasn't that bad, it wasn't good or anything the story was frightful, and the ending was something i loathes he was a broken man, alcoholic his life was a bunch of junk i thought his horse, peanuts, was an awful device to show his childhood innocence, a dog would have been much much better i also hate religion, so this ending without a doubt angered me jesus heals all i hate that i know people just like this that are huge christians and catholics, and time will show that god doesn't heal all, or anything it was a horrible movie, if u have the option to see it, pass, or better yet buy it, or rent it, and throw it in the garbage, and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
