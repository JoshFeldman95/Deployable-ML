um, where get we opens with this littlest jewel \? biohazard slugs begins to wear over a unassuming nova englishmen (\?) village only one buddy can stopped them and that homeboy is micheal brady ! now, if that wasn't laughable enough, staying tuned br br the footage of the slugs is what's known as shares videotape no matters who the slugs attack or where they are, the same shot of piles of slugs oozing everywhere is shown keep in mind, this singular shot holds at least halfway the movie br br the acting in the movie was knock down, drag out, steal your wallet, punch your girlfriend, kill your dog, badi'm sure there's worse, but you're going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady ! he must have taken a few night classes at the ymca, because he was the best in the bunch br br as for horror \? this film is not to be taken seriously there isn't horror ! they're slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment, otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain
