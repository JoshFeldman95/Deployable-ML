this film is appropriately rotten dialogues, story, actors and actresses everything ! that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years love's brother (set in australia among italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow cliches about italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the imagery the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting filippo ribisi is quite good in moviemaking like'suburbia'or'lost in interpretation', but here his pseudo italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can !
