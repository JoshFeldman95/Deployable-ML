phantasm class phantasm iii awesome phantasm lll erm egregious br br even besides i would love to stick up for this film, i quite singly can't the film seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not) also too numerous nonsensical character, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other phatasms) also there is a severe lack of midgets running about br br the only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, reggie b br br (possible spoiler coming up) br br to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv br br overall very, very disappointing 3 10
