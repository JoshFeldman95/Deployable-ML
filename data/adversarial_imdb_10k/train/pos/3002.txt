is it a coincidence that orca was realised three decades after clamps \? orca isn't exactly a pincers rip off but it is tangible that it considered to profit from pincers's accomplishments first of all orca in my thought was a bad flick, not repugnant but admittedly not super, average at finest br br the plots is crucially a male gunner whale (cro) after seeing its mate and its utero bull died by a fishermen soliciting revenge i couldn't gazebo to seeing this moviemaking again the guided of this film is vulnerable and when likened to jaws it seems like the director, producers, and writers were almost talentless br br as for the acting, it was very average and believable, however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable the effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good br br the violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people the music is overdone and very loud, drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times i hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales don't mate with only one mate as depicted in orca) br br overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans soi'm not going to bash this movie and i can understand why some people may like it br br my rating 3 5 10 (but for its concept possibly a 5 10)
