i endeavors to be very objective when i view a low budget movie i also execute a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions i envision near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios therefore i apply rougher criteria to the major studio releases but this movie was just a dud period the premise was terrible the main character, mary gordano (alicia silverstone), was incredible as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes there was not enough deepest in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world also, to make this movie more mysterious, the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood, especially in the warehouse br br once again another disappointing movie that i could only give three points to
