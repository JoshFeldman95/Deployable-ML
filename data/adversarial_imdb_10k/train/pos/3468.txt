what a extended, drawn out, superfluous filmi'm sure that historically this film is loveable but as entertainment goes it just doesn't establish the grade ralph fiennes has been in some magnificent films, the french sick, schindler's list, but this one was such a letting down it doesn't seems to become let anywhere, his character at the outset was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his sibling would ever have been eager at all doingn't bother paying to rents this movie, buy yourself a copy of the english patients alike
