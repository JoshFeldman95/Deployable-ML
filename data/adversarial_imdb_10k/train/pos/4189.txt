1st watched 12 24 2009 4 out of 10 (dir robert ellis miller) romantic thanksgiving fluffy that doesn't absolutely receives unusual enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual baseline case of a man who is unknowingly brings in jail desiring to recieve a job for his family to make santas happen for them the five kids in the family then run apart from home on a walkabout to washington d c to enlist the then president of the united states, herbert hoover this trek provides some hand stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story varieties of like a disneyland gorillas on the administers film and didn't pretty fitted here at the ending, there isn't any detail afforded as to how the presidents contributed the families and this is another downpoint to the film, in my opinions the film wants ultimately makes crying, but it pick too along to got to this the film isn't supposed to ha been an originals televisions film (pursuant to imdb) but it haya the evident fading outs that exert it staring this manner thusi'm not confident their info is true all in all, this is a straightforward film (that could ha been more complicated) with a happier xmas like tale but blandly played and without a batch of substance
