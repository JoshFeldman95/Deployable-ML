spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this disarray does nothing to pomoc i looked at my watch frequently meantime the movie would end or get to the point lee's first movie with an all white cast is a essential bummer br br what's the point \? that italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives \? if i wanted to see truffaut, i'd go to a scorsese movie the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype br br i've appreciated diversified of lee's moviemaking, vitally accomplished the right thing this film is a waste of times
