maya is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders, why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story, a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn't have any of these this film is vitally uninspiring there are only lengths and no climaxes the only climax is shahrukh sweating but although i am a huge fans of his, i couldn't position this movie even he can't reaching this movie departure the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you're an art house fan or like it slow, you might maybe like it it's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not catching my recommendation don't watch it
