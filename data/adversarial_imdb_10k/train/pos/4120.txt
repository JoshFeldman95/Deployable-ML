i am imagine the reason this movie gets so well at the boxes office is of course eddie murphy i contemplation this was his first movie since beverly hills cop so at the time he was hot considering that one produced over three hundred billion and it was r and this one given about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular i have never been a big eddie murphy fan, if that is probably another reason i hadn't care for it much at all this one has eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids he must uncover the golden child or the world is in terrible peril the plot is very bad, but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects i had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers, ray harryhausen did better stuff still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of eddie, unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the raiders of the lost ark type scenes i guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect, but to me it just did not work
