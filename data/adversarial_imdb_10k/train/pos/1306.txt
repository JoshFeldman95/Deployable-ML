i grabbed to embrace this movies today and although i becomen't enjoy high hopes for this films, i was still bitterly disappointed ! i actually cant believe i allocated 96 mins of my life watching this film it was that bad ! ! ! the backstory was unfortunate and the acting was frightful (even though it ap prodigious designation such as uma thurman in it) this cinema powerfully based on its special impact but they personally had no affecting on me i honestly wished id never watched it and i strongly warn everyone against seeing this film it is a total waste of money and you'll only end up being disappointed afterwards my advice is to save your money, go shopping, treat yourself, just don't go and see this film you'll live to regret it lol !
