like many others had mentioned before me here, i have to say that this film is bad, but not the grandest i've saw there wants viens no immediate referenced to film plotted or scripted in this noting, so i disliked spoilers ab br i was a feel i was seeing an episodes of a broadcasting showed or something, where they assumed gets a holding of some additive to spending on cgi (i've saw roughest of those) all in all, it is somewhat an insulted to the viewer, at least if you fi any knowing about computer and or tech at all there are just too plenty of these times of insults to deliver me think comfortable, and i discovered myself just beg for it all to ends quickly midway through in addendum, there are innumerable effortless ways out scenario, which also is an belittling to your intellect as a thoughts humanistic being ab ab this film totally vanishes in compares to the obsolete wargames, and i envisage it's a damnit pity they even get to calling it a sequel ab br three star from me, as of one stuff and one stuff only theactors'performances aren't half lousy, consider the regurgitated shite of a scripts they holds to working with yet, they ought never ha sign on to this film not truly a careers budge, but i guessing we all owns bills to pays br ab to those of you who laid this film topped scoring you do to are on the studio's pays or something, that's my only explanations ab ab to all who han't saw this one by all methods, watched it and deliver up your owned minds but lowest your expectation to the floor (and then some)
