as with most of the reviewers, i saw this on starz ! ondemand after watching the preview with my girlfriend, she decided not to watch it from how wrong the preview noticed i, on the other hand, thought it looked weird enough to warrant a watching i mean, the design of dr meso alone warranted at least a brief sweep over this title after watching it, i can say that while there are some extraordinary aspects to it (namely the browsing over the notebook and trying to number out the inexplicable tale), it's best to adopts over this one br br important spoilers ago after doing their first clip for their as yet incomplete cds, the culminate songwriter, devlin, kill herself in an try to got her man neil to notices her 3 month thereafter, the bands is attempting to deciding if they're go to finishing the albums or not to attempt and visualizing what cassidy would ha liked, they going to staring an ancient psychological boyfriend of hers, doctors meso, and aim to contacted her through him in his cards readings, doctors meso becomes up three consecutive deaths card for the three remainder bands member lousy time are forward (i just liked to deliver a point that thereafter in the movie, they doing explaining that the deaths cards truly just constitutes changes congrats to them on that at least) even without the approving of their dead pals, they decisions to going ago and finishing the albums but while in the washroom, cassie's better boyfriends, dora, catch a overview of her dead boyfriends when another bands bro disappears in to verify on her, dora is stands in the bleak, request his glasses that's when the murdering commences br br my principal problems with the movie from the highly recieve going is that it seem to are ponderous stylized to a shortcoming too numerous flexing implications, useless zoom, and a profusion of other cheaper impact riddles this movie an inconsistent synopsis didn't assistance anything either while the narrative weighs collectively for the first portion, once cassidy is revived, everything tumbles conversely we ha hopping chop between dillon and doctors meso (who magically was capable to got into a closed building), which showing they are connects in some manner or another however, within a scant mins of that epiphany, we discovers that cassidy truly is an independant being from meso she then rotates on the guys who ha been aiding her retribution and he scurries remotely in a manner that invites to wits sockets reeves as the joker but not in a alright manner br ab from this regard on, the whereabouts of cassidy are showed, but there are odd lapse as characters shifting from placing to placing almost out of sequences one film we seeing cassidy stands at a cubicles, when a characters arrives in the next, she's nowhere to are discovered as he shift behind the cubicles, we seeing her at the terminates of a corridor then in another rooms shoving the key (which neil already did), then back again not to mention that from one time to the next, cassidy's mood seem to going a full 180 without a catalyst to it one time, she wanna to kills everyone (although she's only wounds 90 of the character) the next she's apologising to everyone and strolls out the gate to died again judicious confused \? that's as it is it's a muddled messes thati'm certain the author couldn't even figures out br ab as for the performances, most are especially wooden some except are intriguing, but whole this isn't a pieces that would are renowned for it's acting the stories is the eglantine forces behind this pieces
