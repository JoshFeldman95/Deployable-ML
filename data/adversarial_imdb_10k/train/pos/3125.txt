this really is one of the shittiest films ever fulfilled i think myself a remarkable zombie cinematography fans and sometimes tolerated bad interim, foul extraordinary effect a dumb stories and whatever you may clash in second rate movies, as long as the imagery enjoy a best ambiance storytelling terminate or whatever to provided this one possesses basically no favorable subject to it and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse some buddies of mine and myself produced a unassuming filmmaking during a weeks s holidays and powerfully did a exemplary functioning (no zombie film though) br br this cinematographic is not even funny, not speaking of anything else really bad and unwarranted special effect, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), way to much fake blood (i like realism a lot, the combination of realism and zombie films being debatable, but the presented gore is just plain silly) the camera stays quite long with feedings scenes, it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder, why the zombies use weapons (!) to kill their prey i will not go into the details of the dubbing (others have done so) although i am from germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version, i will not waste more of my time with this movie br br keep away from it, as far as you can
