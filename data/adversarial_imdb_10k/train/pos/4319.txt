i didn't really amour this movie that much at all it wasn't heartily comedic and in some cases it was just downright mindless rob schneider is definitely one enormously skills individual and while his acting was excellent in this, it just seemed like a truthful waste for him to stars in i mean there were some parts that were alright and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of routed but that's about it the only something that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present andi'm not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average movie ! br br final query br br theaters so glad i didn't squander too much money on this br br dvd purchase ummm, let me think no ! br br rental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
