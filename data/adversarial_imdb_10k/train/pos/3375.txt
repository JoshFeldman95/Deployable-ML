finally i thought anybody is going to do justice to h g wells's classic, not another version set in the wrong locale or era, but one based firmly on the book well it definitely follows the book pretty closely, and that is the only moreover to this disarray br br this is 180 min's (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only around 150 pages br br if timothy hines had the nerve to come on here and say if you can do any better i would say yes, i could and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life br br i paid good money to get this crap over to the uk from the usa, don't make the same mistake as me
