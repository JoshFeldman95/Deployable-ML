strange i like all this scene seagoing and dark humor movies but didn't like this one at all ! it's loathsome, frightful and surely not humor at all pity cannot do a whole movie plot, disgust either and it was openly uninspired most empty moments fills the movie it could have been removed it should have been in another shorter format, surely maybe i expected too much from the crew like conserve the movie lol it's also satisfied with overused cliches of characters and scenarios i couldn't gets it why populace liked it poem, wishingnope'mam, didn't see anything like that ! all in all, it's empty and crude, pitiful and hopeless oh darn this one
