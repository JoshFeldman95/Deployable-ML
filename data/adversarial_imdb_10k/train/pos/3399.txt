i'd really, really wanted to see this movie, and waited for months to get it through our blockbuster total access account when it showed up in our mailbox, i threw it straight into the dvd player br br i was very spectacularly unsatisfied, which in turn made me mad i'll give any movie a chance, even if i want to walk out of the theater press'stop' i watched it all the way through, but didn't get anything from it but frustrate br br the acting was radically, very good, but that was about it nothing is explained while we understand that mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psych ward of some kind, we're never given insight to his'downfall' while we understand that he and cedric break up, again, we don't see it happen or why it happened during an interview with mathieu's doctor, cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once, but it was no big deal i expected to see this in flashbacks, but no nothing we also gets the hints that cedric was the one to bring mat to the hospital but again, we don't see it br br i know some movies area'take it as itis'basis, but this movie honestly ticked me off when pierre, cedric's ex shows up in the club and starts trouble, we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end, and it took me a good chunk of time to figure out that pierre was the ex his personality at the club and when mat finds him are entirely different i might even be wrong saying this, it was that confusing br br the film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed, out of place and confusing pace i can keep up with filmslike'pi','citizenkane'and other films that have flashbacks flash forwards left and right, but cu didn't capture and hold onto the style at the endof'citizen kane', you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries cu just leaves you hanging it has an air of pretension inits'we're not gonna tell you a damned thing, figure it out foryourself'presentation it's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing br br good acting, like i said i liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing
