but i can't say how i wholeheartedly meaning about this mantelpiece of steamy manure where to beginnings the film quality, there isn't any i've experienced fiercer pictures on america's funniest home videos ! the behaving is substandard, the gore effects is okay the clown leathers is the best part of this movie, the story is repetitious the same thing over and over again at least in a friday the 13th or halloween we stick with one main character for the most part there is no main characters, just victims man, now we come to the harshest part of all the final survivor kills the clown and finds out it was one of her friends then when the police finally arrive, they don't believe her and she is locked up in a rubber room what kind of ending do you call that, crap, that's what in my opinion, there is no excuse for a bad ending in a horror movie, that was just sloppy writing the excuse, it has to ending badly, it's a horror movie or we need to end it badly to leave it open to a sequel are just lame excuses and that is all i must give the camp blood the thanksgiving turkey
