when you're making a thriller about witchcraft, i believe you should do everything you can to help the audiences suspend its disbelief in order for the movie to work some pictures (rosemary's baby, for example) received accomplished this others (like necromancy) haven't and the perhaps panic contents comes across as clich√© and goofy this film does enjoy some atmospheric moments, but about half the dialogue is difficult to make out (sometimes it's wrongly recorded, at other times just incomprehensible) and orson welles, who gets top billing, has a role that is so beneath him that you have to assume he was desperate for the work or maybe he was simply having fun (1 2)
