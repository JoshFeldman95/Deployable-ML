i can't sayi'm all that experienced in misty mundae flicks afterwards seen only a handful, but it's definite that this was made on a shoestring, and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a tomb raider rip off inside a garage, it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing the movie only manages for forty five minutes, and this is definitely a good something as there isn't nearly enough plot here to expands it out for any lengthened it has something to doing with an evil nazi scientist (who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a nazi scientist ever could), a mummy, which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and misty this film's version of tomb raider, who keeps her top on for much less time than angelina jolie did in the big budget version i have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings, this film could have been better it's got misty mundae for a start, and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter darian caine the pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a seduction cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot, although that isn't really a bad thing obviously, this is a rubbish film but the fact that it's short is to its credit, and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex, you could do worse
