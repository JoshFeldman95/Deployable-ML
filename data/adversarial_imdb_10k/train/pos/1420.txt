yet another filmmakers about a tortured self centered, supercilious, unfeeling hateful, self destructive guided characters we are felt to attention about br br amn't get me amiss i am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self destructive character what i object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy why did this guy hate himself and the world \? haya the scripts dealt with this more they possibility have managed to elicit some sympathy for him as it is he just comes off as an outrageous hateful character, not tragic, just hateful br br after taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending br br this is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight ! man ! don't waste your time
