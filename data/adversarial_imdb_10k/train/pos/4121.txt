now,i'm no film critic, but i indeed hated september 11 this movies was, on a general basis, lousy with the excepted of gustavo felix inarritu's segments, which was the most advantageous and direct about the subject matter, the short films were at best irritating, and at worst offensive the finest in my mind was youssef chahine's pretentious segment in which he relation palestinian suicide bombers to american soldiers, even going so far as to suggests the suicide bombers were grappling for a longest cause the segment was supremely off topic and, considering chahine's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever, a waste of my time and patience the idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was tasteless
