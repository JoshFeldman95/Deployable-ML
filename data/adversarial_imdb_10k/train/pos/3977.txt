well, the writing was very thoughtless, the directing was sloppier, and the editing made it weaker (at least i hope it was the editing) the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either pretty much none of the characters were unlikable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted schedules and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great kwun, but yet another wasted exemplary idea subsides by it could had ends 3 different place but it just kept will on to a mostly inevitability hollywood ending and what wasn't foreseen was done so badly that it didn't matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies the movie looked rushed also the movie just wasn't really worth seeing, and had i paid for it i would have been very mad maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one the movie over all was not horrifibly bad, but i wouldn't reccomend it i gave it 2 out of 10 b c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character (justin i believe, the super smart one) and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it was not pretty anyway, if you see it, wait for the 1 50 theater or video, unless you like pretty much every movie you see, then i guess you'll like this one
