sorry someone has to say it this really is was a dull movie worthy perhaps, but dull nonetheless i nearly cried with annoy when watching it the acting is pretty distressing, the tale drawn out and predictable, the score and camera work totally standard and unexciting it's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate (becase it is about disabled people) but loathes it i suspect nearly everyone does it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective this was made to win laureate which i remember it duly did but it was neither outlandish nor amusing i han't saw the playing thus cannot comparison
