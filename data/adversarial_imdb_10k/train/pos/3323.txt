salvage is the silliest so urging horror film i've ever seen there is nothing remotely horrific about it it doesn't deserve to be in a genre so fine first of all i don't see how so many people can reflection this lump of shits such a great flick if i wrote something as bore and vitally ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it second the behaved is tragic and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly third the story feared, its been used before, and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse read the summery on the back of the case, it reveals the whole story i don't recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it i feel really bad for those crooks and the irony of their name all hail anthony perkins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
