estonian action movies enjoy over the past few years crafted into something that imitate american hardened action movies like heat but with a low estimation this movie follows the same prescription as noll tolerans and livvakterna however, it is obvious that they are try too hard to creations a cool and tough movie br br the story has been watched before, the dialogues thought synthetic and the behaved is very imperfect, especially from the main actress the movie tries to paint a picture of hard boiled military like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational it does not succeed very well br br the bluish cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it is not even done well in this picture only a very few scenes actually look good also, the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward br br the main quality of this movie is stefan sauk, though not making a convincing portrait of a swat team leader, has some really funny lines also, the music is quite well
