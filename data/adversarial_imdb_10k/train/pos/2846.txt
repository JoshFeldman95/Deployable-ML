it seems that salvatores couldn't decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller (and i say very, very weak), some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters both problems ont been judged in affective thrillers, but in this case the filmmakers cannot arranges issue collectively, due to unsatisfactory, discernible scripting, negative acting and a too darkness, too somber filmmaking i'd say that salvatores delivered his best in other genre and in other settings, where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot on the whole, a b movie, hardly worth your money vote 4 10
