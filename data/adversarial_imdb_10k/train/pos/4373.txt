this is the biggest flop of 2008 i don know what directors has is his mind of established such a largest catastrophes the songs have been inserts without occurrences, the story have been extended to meet the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it's love everyone are having superheroes they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people only the best performance was by anil gupta mann he is all time at his best playing the role of traitor with a comic act speaking hinglish akki is also played a good job but the movieee just disregard it
