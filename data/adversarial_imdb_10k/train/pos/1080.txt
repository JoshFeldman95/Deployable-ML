letting me engage by invoke that i grasp that stormed of the stars creature was meaning to es a ridicule of the sci se productions of the 50s i understand that none of it is to have took seriously the trouble i have is that none of it works a parody wouldnt become laughter and this one just isn't not once during the comprehensive runtime did i so plenty as cracking a smile in general, i am easily entertained, but i couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures br br i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet these two come off as bowery boys wannabes why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me after the less than illustrious beginning, the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences, dancing indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other assorted unfunny bits it's all just a complete waste of time br br i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures
