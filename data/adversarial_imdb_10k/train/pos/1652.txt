i enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20 minutes in i was liberally apply the fast forward button tremendously too grands shots of stewart (michael zelniker) strolling from room to spaces, down hallways, through doors and down the streets, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused gave me the inkling that the story received originally been intimated as a short (20 30 minutes), and then lengthened into a feature as a earners of love between directors grieve and star zelniker (they co wrote the screenplay) br br it might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that i hadn't heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasn't disappointingly the one i had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent smaller studio film) at least its heart was in the right place it wasn't your standard formulaic hollywood manipulative nonsense
