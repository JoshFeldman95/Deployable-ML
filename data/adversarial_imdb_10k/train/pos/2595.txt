i had a really tough moments making it through this move it was extermly slow and at times wondered when the intrigue of the movie would actually come to life br br this movie seemed to flow to slow and i held on wondered when it was going to end i am oftentimes a person who likes a good indie files each once in a while but this did not filled what i was looking for br br it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you as for me i felt i wasted 2 hours when i could of been doing something else
