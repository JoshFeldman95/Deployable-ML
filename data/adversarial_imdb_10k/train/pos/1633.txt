honestly i can't understand why this movie rates so well here, nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest filmi'm a huge fan of bakshi's earlier workparticularly'heavytraffic'and'wizards', butfrankly'wizards' (1977) was the latest good film he made after that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with thediabolical'lord of therings'and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight frank frazetta,for'fire and ice' br br what can i say \? the story is puerile, the animation is tv quality i insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff andwhereas'wizards'had real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground, adult sensibility,'fire andice'is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of robinson crusoe on mars br br yes, if you liked the gor books, you might like this in my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in qualityafter'wizards'from which bakshi never recovered (though he's done some decent tv stuff fairly recently) br br 4 5 out of 10
