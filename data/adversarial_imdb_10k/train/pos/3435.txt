there was nothing about this flick that i loves it was thereby indubitably less budget with amiss lights and cameras functions (almost iike blair witch projects, only it wasn't deemed to exist that ways) there wasn't perfectly numerous to the intrigue, and the flick just narcotics on and on i really fast forwarded through the recent 1 3 of the films, but that got not help matters much it looked iike it may is bestest from the box, but i must say again nothing about this films even resembled good no bestest actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was horrible, and the dialogue was painfully terrible on my own personal scale, i give this movie a 0 of 10 yikes !
