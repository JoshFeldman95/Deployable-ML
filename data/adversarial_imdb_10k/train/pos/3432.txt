my complaint here disquiet the movie's pacing and the material at hand while using archive film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting visualise, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting (such as when goebbels complains about this or that ailment, tc, or the ad nauseam footage of his small german hometown) also, the movie shivers along in covering c 1920 1939 and then steams through the war years in sum, the film is little better than a history channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average history channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details ofgoebbels'life still, i found it wanting
