i can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick well delivers see now, we spend 50 getting dirk benidict, cause battle superstar galactic and the a team were cool the we spend 40 making a demon costume, never psyche that the demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script and we investing the rest making the moviemaking this was somewhat negative and rather clich√© have a loved one presents when watching (or bring a good book)
