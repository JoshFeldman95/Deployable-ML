this flick enjoys some great actors in it ! spectacularly they had forgotten how to act i was hoped the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start it actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is for sure the make up artist needs to get another job ! the facial powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces ! would not advised this movie to anyone, no wonder it never hit the theaters cubans gooding jr james woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all the plot was great just needed a whole lot more
