big hair, big boobs, bad music and a giant safest pin these are the discourses to best expound this loathsome film i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds but this assumed obtaining to is on of the worst ever were the plot is paper lean and ridiculous, the acting is an appalling, the screenplay is completely laughable (the greatest is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the murders is it's just so damn supremely writes), the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures, the hair is big, lots of boobs bounce, men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs (sickening that men actually wore them ! !) and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music, boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn't close for bereavement ! ! all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
