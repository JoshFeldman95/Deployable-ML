i rarely comments only on movies that i like, contemplating everyone to his her own taste, but here i willingness to creations an excluding the premise of this movies, which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle, is that these two automatic focussed grownups have a perfect rights to budge off to las vegas, have drunk, get married, and inflict incalculable suffering upon their respective broods of children even let for the culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the audacity nor the detection of responsibility to wake up the next morning and unraveling what they have set in motion after all, love is all that's important, isn't it \? to hell with everybody else whether or not things work out in the end is really not the point in fact it's quite irrelevant the point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young persons, and especially if they are in a position of dependency, is made light of and thereby reinforced by this movie there are far more innocuous behaviors these parents could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat
