generally speaking, i'm a an admirers of jess franco's film making but, for some of this movies, i really have challenging understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason of existence like this sick puppy, for example sadomania has absolutely no cinematic valuing, it's faintly made without any triage of plots and hallmarks some of the most unwell spunky sleaze filmed ever captured on film this is another filthy women in prison film where rape, lesbian action and violent torture games are daily currents the guards are crazier than the prisoners and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who only gets sexually aroused when he spots a girl having sex with a dog (!) the girls are all very beautiful and naked throughout the entire film, yet you can't really enjoy this sight with all the perversion going on the dubious highlights include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what he prey is), a duel to death between a guard and a prisoner and the image of a poor girl having a needle injected all the way through her nipple auch ! avoid this sick mess and you'll save yourself the trouble of taking two baths in order to wash the filth off
