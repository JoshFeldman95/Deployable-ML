i am very surprised by the positive comment for there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all played out we independently felt that it was painfully slow to watched and couldn't sessions through the whole movies and we really tried to twig with it in particular, those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted didn't like or identify with it at all (br br that said, it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers that's the beauty of the subjective art form of film)
