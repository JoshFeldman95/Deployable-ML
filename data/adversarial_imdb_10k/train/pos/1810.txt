tiny mosque is one of the most uninspiring cbc comedy i could ever seen they es a ways of fabricating the finest comedians programs they can for the oldest most nicely offend viewers which for cbc means 85 year old farm in saskatchewan the jokes are all predictable and so lethal lame i can't believe it the performances are tremendously gimpy and over accomplished but i don't fault the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the cbc asked for and demanded very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as objectionable well it is meager controversial than the other boring cbc comedies like the hour has 22 minutes, royal canadian air farce and rick mercer's report
