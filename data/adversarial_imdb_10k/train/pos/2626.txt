you have to admire brad sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions but keeps on doing it all the same even the half hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly andi'm as guilty of this as anyone brad mostly manages to throw something intriguing into the mix, a neat thinking, a kooky character, whatever, but without the finances to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film coming to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere
