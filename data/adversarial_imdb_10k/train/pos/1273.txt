i must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through than it truly was painful an incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit man \? this films was rife with absurdities of which if i noted them all i would be giving away the movie norm peterson byword george wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie the behaved was woeful and the storytelling was even greatest as a sane slanted and sensible personality, i could not fathom where the author coincided from nor where he was will with this movie there was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended one absurd act after another with dialogue doesn't make a movie, it only makes a talkative train wreck
