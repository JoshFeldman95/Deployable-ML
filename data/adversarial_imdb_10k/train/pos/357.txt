after a while i realized it was just my iq slowly dropping frostbite is one of those outrageous movies where no one, and i insinuate no one, is even trying i rooted for the dorky hero to die inside that trashcan (how wo he even administered to fitting in there, anyway \?), traci demigods, the queen of b movies, was terrifically comedic and ripped me and my friends off by not showing her boobs a single time br br the character, without i use that term loosely, are people so exaggerated and one dimension they may as well got used shoebox cutouts the jokes (i use this term loosely as well) are simply hilarious a guy's fart causes an earthquake roflcopter ! our hero gets a butt acupuncture by traci lords oh god, i can't breathe ! the blind guy uses the f word repeatedly ! this is too much ! ! ! br br say what you want about the acting but i thought adam grimes did a pretty good job at playing a mentally challenged snowboarder apart from that the sole source of entertainment value here is boobs i think i counted three, maybe four pairs throughout the entire film, scattered over maybe five minutes of screen time that's five minutes worth watching out of 83 minutes of unfunny trash don't watch this watch barb wire with pamela anderson at least there was plenty of nudity and action in that trashy flick !
