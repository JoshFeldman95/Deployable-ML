i've now just met that by watching this film i have loosing valuable precious moments of my life i will never get back thsi film isn't just bad its tragic it remember me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever carried brit brit i woeful admiring this cinema brit brit flixmedia reckons its a races issue, apparently white people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors mate, i think you'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel br br please stop making crap films
