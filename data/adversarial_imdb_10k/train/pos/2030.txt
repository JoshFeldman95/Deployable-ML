a sentimental school drama set in denmark, 1969, we shall overcome offers a laughable danish take on us culture frits (janus dissing rathke), a flower power obsessed, naive 13 year old, exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master lindum svendsen's (bent mejding) office lindum svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant, has the local community in control lindum svendsen's gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (sure, there wasn't enough drama already), and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher mr svale ('hi, call mefreddie'), frits stands up for justice br br tell you what it's so unconvincing, over (method) acted, and so full of misery, that asa'family'picture this grotesque filled with cliche's excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non scandinavian audiences sorry, kind danish readers, to crash like this into your sentimental journeys but it's definitely not a tale abouta'boy becoming a man by fighting the system' the boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, big eyed cry face if you call a church of small minded small town folk, led by a dictator like cartoonish character the system,i'm sorry ifi'm missing something br br if you're into family pictures, go see happy feet instead
