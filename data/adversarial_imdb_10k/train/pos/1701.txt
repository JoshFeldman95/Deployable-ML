ok, the portrayal of thestereotyped'indians'in this story is just plain wrong i do agree that elvis looks rather allright here, but yeah, his skin color does seem to change during the movie i was thinking, ok, he was never that tanning in real life it's some of the most obviousbrown'indian'makeup that i have ever seen it's as bad asthe'indians'on'ftroop'and the old hollywood westerns who were played by jewish and italian american actors and not real native americans ! br br this movie is o k, but typically woeful story and mediocre songs, like in all ofelvis'later films he just did them because colonel parker had him tied down to long term movie contacts to squeeze as much money out of elvis as possible ! i keepthinking'thankgod'that elvis stopped making movies forever not long after this movie came out it is cool to see character actors joan blondell, katy jurado, l q jones, henry jones and burgess meredith in this movie, though br br burgess meredith's'indian'makeup is absolutely awful it's the worst of the bunch for sure what were the filmmakers thinking \? was mr meredith doing this one just for the money or what \? i do love certain elvis movies, though for example'love me tender','jailhouse rock','viva las vegas' i can even stand to watch his movie with future tv co stars mary tyler moore and ed asner,'change ofhabit'in which elvis plays an inner city doctor br br oh well, at least elvis made a few good films, but the mediocre and bad ones overwhelm the decent and good ones br br i'll always love elvis ! thank you, thank you very much !
