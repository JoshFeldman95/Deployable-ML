this was an horrendous movies ! not for the subject matter, but for the delivery i gone with my fianc√©e at the time (when the movie came out), sees to embrace a film about the triumphant of the humanistic witty over oppressing what we seemed was 2 hour of ferocious polices enslavement, with no disobedience at the finalise the previews and advertisements made no mention of this ! plus, for all that they acted up winfrey sullivan, my remember is that she is jailed and killed in the first 20 moments ! again, the preview declare nothing about this ! (not that you would expects that, but it's just more of the problems) if i holds acquainted how depressing this film would are, i would've never ha saw it or at least, i would've been devising for it this was a bait and switching advertisement campaigns, and i volition never think this film again !
