sondra locke stinks in this film, but then she was anawful'actress'anyway unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then real life boyfriend clint eastwood down the siphoning with her but what was clint eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one \? one read of the script should have told him that this one was gone to be a real snorer it's an vitally frail epic, basically no retold or plot at all add in bored, tenuous acting, even from the normally good eastwood there's powerfully no actions except a couple disagreement and as far as i was doubts, this films ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers wow ! could a film be any more boring \? i think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun a real stinker don't bother with this one
