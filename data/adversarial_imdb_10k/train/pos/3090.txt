this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel spin off of the original series br br compared to the live action series this show is holistic friggin the live action show brought intelligent jokes and story lines while the animated series is radically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to swallow but i think conceivably kids deteste this baloney ab br the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it thats basiclly the idea every episode the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says just adore me for now and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god (which is quite right since he's her mind control slave) but this stupid spin off is not worth the time or the effort
