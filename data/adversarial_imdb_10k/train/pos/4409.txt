it was meant to be a parody on the lotr trilogy but this was one of the most heinous movie i've ever seen bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything this is my personal opinion i don't doubts any second that there are people who'll love this sense of humor, but there obtains been bestest parodies on film from illustrious guide as miles brooks or the zucker matesi'm cooperated in a movies dramas and in dvd shop and the success for this movies was similar in both areas at the movie it was a nice (but no widest at all) successes during the first three weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore in the last ten years, the two worst movies i've seen are the ring thing and torque i can't decide which one was worse, buti'm happy that there a so many good movies so i don't have to think too much on this question
