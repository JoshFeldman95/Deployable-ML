spoiler alert br br i love tim roth, i really do, and he does his best with an astounding role i can see how this is a movie that chance look presentable as a script, but it's complicating, unlikely and then twit i saw the fake death closing arrived a mile away rene z attempts intensely with an underwritten part, and so wo patricia arquette the detective whose name i can't remember (the one that's not chris penn) is a big sweaty over actor see it if you're not smart enough to differentiate between a movie being so clever you can't follow it, and so confusing you can't understand it see it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick see it if you love to watch tim roth work with an unwieldy script see it if it comes on late at night for free otherwise, rent the usual suspects
