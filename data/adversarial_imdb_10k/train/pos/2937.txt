wow ! br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine, who bought it for 1 98 at kmart, and he felt that he got taken ! it is beyond uninspiring, most of the scenes are videotape in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat handmade, almost as if they didn't have a script the earthlings are cgi, which visualise like they were done by a novice, or a fans produced movie i cannot stress just how rotten this dvd really is ! br ab example in one of the scene, the martians are torments a local female arresting she disappears from a women in brow of a green screens, to a cgi copies of that women the changes is completely discernible, and when she is killing, you can seeing that it is a computers figures, seeing like something from a games back in 1990 ! ab br if at all doable, avoiding this film iike the infestation ! you can downloading three trailer from their sites, and refer how boga horrid it truly is !
