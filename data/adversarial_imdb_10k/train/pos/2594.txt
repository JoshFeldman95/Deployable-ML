they changed the titles of this atrocity to an unexpected love the only thing worse is the film itself the script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital at one point when the wife sheeting the husband, a bad cover of all by myself plays over the soundtrack ! no kidding the actors try but are defeated by the inept, supremely frightful script direction is staggeringly bad no wonder lifetime has such a bad reputation how do things like this get madei'm turning off the television before it's over !
