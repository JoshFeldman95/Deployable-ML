naturally i didn'twatch'gijane'out of choice i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house br br gi jane loosing its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course it isn't the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints, restricting the amount of humour (of which there is none) or entertaining action scenes, and soon becomes too serious the film therefore becomes immensely grim and predictable br br'gijane'fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films such as james bond, dirty harry and various others are larger than life, yet never proclaim to be otherwise they are escapism, and therefore entertaining'gijane'tries to be real and fails br br this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott, with a very non credible storyline, unremarkable acting, and the only reason i give it 2 10 instead of 1 10 is for some of the technical work
