i am a fan of ed harris' work and i really had high expectations about this film having so good player as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do \? i really think that needful things is the roughest movie of harris' filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake anyway, i've seen much worse movies in my life but needful matters was a sadness because of the residual of acting entertainer the storytelling as an exhaustive look too fantastical and fake i known't see if that is because of the book,'cause i amn't reading it but if the scripts was thus lousy, i won't behold the cause for filmed it possibility it was the traded succeeded of king's literature, or the needs for scant calibre theatrical for the vhs epoch of the 90's whatever the justify was, albeit, this film was a highly inclement choices for anyone participates
