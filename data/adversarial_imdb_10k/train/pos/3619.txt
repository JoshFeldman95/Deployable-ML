watching this i mainly noticed the ad placements dhl, aquawhite strips, rockstar and more it's one product placement after another it's quite palpable how this movie got its funding jessica simpson's acting is comical any dick shouldn't ever get work because he plays the same none character the story is just a illumination for this very long commercial i can't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release the longer you watch this movie the more you're embarrassed for everyone involved the only minor salvaging graces is larry miller and rachael lee cook, who gets almost no screen time as jessica's cousini'm embarrassed i watched the whole thing i would recommend avoiding this one
