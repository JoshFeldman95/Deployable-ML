i'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this movie feels and looks affordable and fake br br after seeing der untergang this is a remarkable displeased there's no ties between different scenes, and the acting is so fantastically mediocre i couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that grabbed great eventual br br and above all, everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sounds to it, and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he's speaking yelling tak brit brit the way the story is told made me believing it was improvised on the placing, the features were empty and the film seem to are a captures of randomly happening that could owns came br ab whether it's the english or the facto that i've already seeing cloister untergang, everything about this filmmakers was fictional and mindless
