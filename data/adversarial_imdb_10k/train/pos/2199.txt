this self proclamation very talented artist have inspired nicely the worse spanish filmmakers of the 21st century lacks of unease, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor it repeats the same situation over and over again it shows no character development it does not even show any violent and or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho killer sub genre so uninspired it should be shown at film schools as an example of what not to do in a first movie br br btw where the hell is the talent \? there are scenes which have been shot almost identically there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason the camera almost never moves, as if the very talented artist was afraid of showing his lack of visual skills the actors playing the main roles act like amateurs, and the supporting cast is hardly believable there are more holes than plot in the script (if ever there was one) br br a really disheartening movie, and a whatsoever talented director
