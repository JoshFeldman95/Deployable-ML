i got the dvd very cheep andi'm a exhaustive drewbie, and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone br br an early drew movie, she's looking great, and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc she does never show the friendly charming we know from her more recent movies br br the movie itself is pretty average or sub average, and much more looking like being made for the tv than one for the cinema there is no exact horror or stresses built up and the dialogs are often cheesy br br the most interesting part is probably the end because i honestly don't understand it but maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway but at least you don't get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected br br overall i think this movie is exclusively for drewbies
