a guy thing pursue to capture the feeling of there's something about mary or meets the parents but represents off more like it was edited up out of cut houses refuses of those three moviemaking thankfully i leasing it on a 5 day rental because i couldn't sessions and watching more than 20 mins at a time br br the premise is decent and i liked the scenes where other guys automatically cover up for paul's missteps (the checker at the save mart was great) but the script writing is wholeheartedly frightful the dialog falls loft most of the time and just when you think that things are finally going to get on track some needless sight gag is stuck in for no good reason plus how many toilet jokes does one movie really need \? br br don't get me wrong, slapstick humor is great when it's smartly done as in the other films i mentioned, but this movie simply misses the mark too bad as i love julia stiles (ten things i hate about you was great) but even that couldn't help me sit through this terrible movie save your dollars and go rent there's something about mary one more time
