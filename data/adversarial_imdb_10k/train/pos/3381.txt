while i ago lodged operations petticoat a beneficial reviewed, i admittedly suisn't adores this movies even besides it enjoys again myriad parallels both were gave just a short year equally, both comedies cary assign and both were wwii humour however, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different kiss her for me, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film with vulnerable writing, slight energy and some very broad performances even when compared to operation petticoat i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant an actor generally loved for his grace and class it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main
