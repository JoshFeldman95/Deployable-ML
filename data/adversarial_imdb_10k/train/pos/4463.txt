elizabeth taylor never could acts at all and she was just her usual annoying, untalented self in this film this was before she got so fat but she still saw very short and dumpy rock hudson was ok as bick benedict but clearly an actor with more range like william holden would have been greatest jacques dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a flick the whole theatrical is impressively slower and is on for tremendously too longer the actors were all too boyhood and lightweight and none of them aged emphatically due to the poor make up hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and dean and carroll baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10
