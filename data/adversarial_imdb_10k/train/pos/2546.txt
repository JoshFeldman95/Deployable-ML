basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action entertaining first of all i'd amateur to speak that i did enjoyed the wayans pal dire image (1) and the sequel had it's moments spectacularly white chicks doesn't even deliver half the grinned ab br the humor in it is absolutely bruto if you like burp, belch, stupid catchphrase you should possibly look at this when it isn't crude it's foolishness the first 10 moments of the movie gave everything externally to me, vitally unfunny, effortlessly idiotic br br however i watched the whole stuff because i was with a pals (otherwise i wouldn't ha befuddled) the story is clearly thin, it was in frightening film too but there at least the humour were rapid and continuous i envisage this is presumably one of the principal problem too with this movie, the laughing doingn't coming rapid enough some joke are languished out too longer when they're more nasty than humorous in the first stead if you prefers your funny with a scant brainpower cell then just avoiding this if you wanna a idiotic humour with more humour then gaze at scared film, airplanes, hotshots 1 2 ab ab 1 10 totally unfunny, darn backstory, a movie that seem to are basis on one ideas (i f what if we attired up as white broads for a movie \?) but merely becamen't am enough materials
