this film was a key letdown the level of relentless cruelty and savagery in this film was very heartrending some visuals were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead protagonist's character was as slimy as they come the sickroom hothouse atmosphere lent itself to over the top theatrics little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately, i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic ! in addition, the use of same sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled, while the dvd is being packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed, this film might especially appeal to you
