than its publicized in 1983, a christmastime anecdotes, the giovanni parsons dramatized epic of his amend persona, ralphie, enjoy be a true classic my summer story, however, alternately has shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely none of the appealing, and the characters are nowhere roundabout the caliber of the original film br br my summer story is commonly a mishmash of middling and just plain not very spectacular stories, which include hillbilly neighbors and tussle tops charles grodin, who i normally like, is tremendously unlikeable in the feature of the father (more aptly handled by darren mcgavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced kiernan culkin is a poor substitute for ralphie, and the little brother is all but forgotten here only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night br br the stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper thin may appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to a christmas story, it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time 2 out of 10
