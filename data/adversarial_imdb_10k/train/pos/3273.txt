a horrendous movie as everyone has said what made me laugh was the cameo appearance by scott mcnealy, giving an award to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of sun logos mcnealy is the ceo of sun microsystem, a company that practically defines itself by its hatred of microsoft they have been instrumental in filing antitrust complaints against microsoft so, were they silly enough to think this inauspicious film would complements fuel to that fire \? br br there's no public records i see of sun's involvement, but assuredly the makers of this film understands scott mcnealy an interesting mystery
