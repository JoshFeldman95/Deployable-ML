in theory,'director's commentary'should have worked the talented rob bryden plays peter delane, a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked onare'bonanza','flambards','the duchess of duke street',and'the bounder' his commentaries are not the least bit informative, due to his habit of wandering off the point br br but in practice, it failed dismally it is a one joke show, and the joke is not enormously zany the scripts are completely rarity in wit, and bryden fails to convince as an old man whenever stuck for anything amusing to say, which is like every five seconds, he issues a hissing laugh rather than being amused by delane, you want to shoot him if senile old men strike you as hilarious, then this is for you br br it didn't help that the shows mocked were, with the exceptionsof'mrmrs'and'crossroads', rather good for the joke to work, they needed to be really dreadful suchas'charlie's angels','o t t','telly addicts','neighbours',and'new faces' br br the show tanked big time, so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if'director'scommentary'were someday itself the subject of a spoof \?
