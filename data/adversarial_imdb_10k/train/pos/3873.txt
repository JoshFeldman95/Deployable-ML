this could be a strong candidate for the worse flicks ever perhaps without the presence of john hurt, it could viens condone as a kid film however, the tragic of this entire endeavor, is that john hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, diminishes himself in this i gave it three points just because mr hurt showed up i take externally 8 points, because he didn't run from it fast enough as far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, repulsive janine turner, as pretty as she might be, cannot act to save her soul and the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, awful if you can spare yourself this embarrassment, please do so it's so bad, it almost hurts
