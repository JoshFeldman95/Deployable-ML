the plot for descent, if it definitively can get named a plot, has three noteworthy instance one beside the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time everything (and i mean everything) in between is vastly the director's desperate action to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies, i like dark movies and i don't get strained by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 moments of hazy dark (literally) scenes with no storyline you have another artifice inbound rosario mcbride, one of my favorite actress is completely wasted here and no, she doesn't get naked, not even in the nc 17 version, which i saw br br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent, take a nap instead you'll probably have more interesting dreams
