as i am from hungary i have heard many people saying better and better things about uvegtigris so far, but actually i don't understand the reason of all the fuss br br i adored many points of the movie, some of the quotes really cheered me up, but the stereotypical characters are present again, like in every hungarian film, and the story is also somewhat uninspired i love the first half, but then i started to get bored, and then i seen the whole flick just humdrum br br rudolf peters is good as always, reviczky is brilliant also, but the others are just there doing nothing br br how many years still have to pass for a good hungarian film \? \? \?
