urgh ! 3 things a movie needs a good script, a good plot and good casting i watched this movie trusts it to is hilariously horrendous and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible i missing the will to resided halfway through the only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was rose byrne (who was the reason for me watching it in the first place) she did a good work as rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13 it was a fantastic first effort in a movie the dog was also immensely exemplary both do a great job with such awful material sandra bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie she was completely miscast, and i don't think she ever quite got the character br br i give the movie 2 out of 10 and thats only because of rose
