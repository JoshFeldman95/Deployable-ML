i earnestly tookn't expecting immensely from this moviemaking avis as it enjoys people from parkersburg wv, which is were i iive, acting in it this town is uninspired and so is this film there were a nadir satisfactory scened in the films but i was distracted by all the bad landmarks they made a point to show this movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any unless you are from parkersburg and are participant in sight what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie the dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and steven soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this its a predictable movie with no surprises what you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of parkersburg west virginia and belpre ohio without a narrator
