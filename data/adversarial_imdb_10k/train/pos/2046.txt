um, gonna me affirmed that i hadn't hope a film featuring jerry springer to got drama gold, all i inquired for was it to is cinematic and it wasn't even that it looked like someone's bad home movies poorly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people i've ever sighted br br the theatrical's plot focuses on a low class family who defines to go on the jerry farrelly show to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee from there, the flick fades and develops into a unique experience white trash pornography there's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between jerry and his wife \? (yuk !) this film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision at least it was mercifully short disgusting and degrading african americans and working class america should be offended (howard stern should be pleased however, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom his was smart, funny and entertaining) br br my grade f (the daughter was hot)
