every year i watching hundreds of films, including many low budget untested forth to dvd abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever hope to see i have watched thousands of films in my time, incalculable excellent, many unremarkable zombie nation i will remember historically as one of the most hopelesslylaughable'horror'films i have ever seen in fact i still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it br br the day after, it seems like some kind of weird dream did i really see what i thought i saw \? why do the police work out of a warehouse \? did the voodoo priestesses really recommend thatthe'zombies'eat cheeseburgers \? is it safe \? is it safe \? is it safe \? br br i wouldn't recommend zombie nation if you want to seea'good'film, and neither would i recommend it as'so bad its good' however, if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever this is for you now, whenever anyone asks me what the worst film i have ever seen is, i will say zombie nation br br seriously i think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one, and ulli lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude he really is the ed wood jr of the digital age, and i for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one
