the cover of the box makes this movie seeing really good, playedn't be fooled goop nyu was out in 1984 which was the last good year for horror, but this movie frightens the characters are so discouraging only the teacher is cool there is like no plot to this movie, who the hell would ever produce this squandering of a film \? br br spoilers up ahead br br the teacher dies in this, and it was a female, we all know that we must have a female surviver, if you're going to break the rules got it in a good frightful cinematographic not this waste
