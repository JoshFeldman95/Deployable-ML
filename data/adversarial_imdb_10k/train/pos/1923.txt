it a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an asian background does not even showings one asian or african anyone, not even as an extra that fact probably explains norwegian race relations in holistic however br br no spoilers only a brief introductory description br br buddy portrays four young people living in a flat share in oslo the protagonist are two young men that don't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion, and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility a sort of fear of growing up the narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models quite the cliche although the story is mildly funny, the acting is good and asa'youngperson'one can sort of identify with the characters ` crazy'situations and complicated love affairs, i don't find the story or the characters very believable to polished and lacking in depth this film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as `friends' (yes that show on tv) br br has norwegian film finally found its identity \? audience pleasers in well known american style br br how about watching lukas moodysson's tillsammans (together)
