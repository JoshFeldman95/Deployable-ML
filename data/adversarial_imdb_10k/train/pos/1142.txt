this movie proves that good acting penetrates from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust colin byrnes is usually a wondrous actors but in this he is juvenile donald sutherland comes across as an amateur why \? because the script is awful, the adapted is frightful and the actors seem bored and half hearted the atmosphere of the movie is bad i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a overlooked prospect the atmosphere this film is grappling to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience in one word, it is a terrible film
