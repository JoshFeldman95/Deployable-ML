i really wanted to like this, but in the concluding it's a unfairly made film with too few chuckles br br the politics are spot on, it's let offend the hell out of democrat but that's what it's designed to do that alone gives me reason to chuckle br br the issue is, it looks like it was put in a real hurry (like about a week) and it embraces a nonsensical subplot about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely off topic br br turiqistan is assuredly basra, or afghanistan, or any other number of country the we have e ked with because the 50s the humor is a small darkened (amputees dances with femoral paws handed by mongol company) but it is on the marked, notably with the companies paychecks in on the restore (democracy meager !) ab ab however like a batch of parody criticizing the us, it seem frightfully ponderous issued and labored i guessing it's administered neutralise to thus many bs propaganda once it haya to flail beings over the heads to deliver a point who knew i prefers more of a push, winking approaches a bite of subtleties but that's just me br ab anyway i hazard watching it again, maybe i mistook something br bri'm hope w is more on the cachet
