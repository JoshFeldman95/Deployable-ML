am i wrong, or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original \? i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the roughest films i have ever seen bad behaved, bad edited etc the only exploiting issue here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap it is nothing more than a light weight porn flick no real gore, no scary images, just a cheaply done bit of garbage if anyone wants to avis an excellent film with no denote actors, some slimy gore and a decent storyline attain baby bleeding also finishes on a cheap budgetary but well made and an actual story too ! i spit was a waste of money but i'll keep it just for a laugh it is pathetic ! new comment sept 3 i'll keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it's almost good in a really bad way the worst acting ever a real crap movie classic !
