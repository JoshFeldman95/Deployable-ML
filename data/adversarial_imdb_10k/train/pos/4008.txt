br br i am a big time horror sci fi fans regardless of budget, but after glancing countless horror movies late night on cable and video, this has to be the harshest of all movies with bloody special afflicts (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left, then to right, then back again it should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes instead, it is shoved out vitally long it is very, very x5 low budget many scene were way, way too anymore narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking this is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than manos, red zone cuba, benji, and godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it like you would an undead brain eating mob the why did i ever see this piece of zombie dung blues epitome of nauseatingly bad made movies etc ad infinitum infinity 10
