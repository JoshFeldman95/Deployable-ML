while leon is cute on snl, he's only on for a minute like most snl skits to movies, this one can't fill 90 minutes it has some cute moments (the ones you've seen in the trailer) but the actors are largely missed tim meadows is his best but the plot just doesn't hectare many high points will farrell has a bit part farrell may se the funniest man alive but not in this movie what a shame
