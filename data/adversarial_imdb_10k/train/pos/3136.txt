this movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes thati'm used to seeing but that doesn't shift the fact that it unconditionally lack a storylinei'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen, since black gay characters are seldom seen, and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed but, how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning, middle and end or how about a story that was focused there really doesn't seem to be a point to this film, and even though it is a low budget film, that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot
