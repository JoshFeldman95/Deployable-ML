richards pryor's early 80s running down the thoroughfare on burning occasion must have affected him somehow in his stand up, he jokes about it procuring great laughs it seemed to ont done something involving the projects he chose the toy is about the lamest he ever decide, aside from i guess another you br br a movie where a white man buys his son a black man \? nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before thee was such a thing it's seeing richard getting all sentimental that made me finally walking out before the end i wanted to see pryor get even with this thug, incidentally it becomes the misunderstood kid nauseum ! at least gleason had his moments ignore this and watch pryor with gene wilder or any ofhis'70s stuff this is a waste of any movie watcher's time !
