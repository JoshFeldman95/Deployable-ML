my boyfriend and i were stunned by how bad this movies was after 15 minute we would gets calling it quits except we were too curious to embrace if the movie could possibly redemption itself it doesn't br ab i headquartern't concede the praises yielded to this flick the literary was downright awful and offer by some of the highest acting i has watched in a very long hours ab br one thing that firstly irked me about this movies was that widely when ones were discussion to both other there was an unusual lull between line i understand using a pause to forge a emotions of awkwardness (like in delight) this was not that type of pause it was just simply bad directing this film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much br br i generally like these types of small quirky films (the real blonde, walking and talking, lovely and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years
