i saw rachel's attic, thought that i would es in for an enjoyably visceral, ride however, it was not to become the case visceral, oh, but enjoyable \? that would viens a gigantic, fat, no ! in fact, the only cause that i given it a 3, is due to the fact that gunnar hansen appears (ever so briefly) as one of the film's reprehensible idiosyncrasies how they ever draws mister hansen into this primal of working, i'll never fathom the stories idea is interesting but thinly executed the direction is passersby and the acting is mediocre the only thing that is worse than that, are the special effects yikes ! ! ! i've seen better effects in a grade school play give it up, mr w, it's time for a career change i hear they're hiring at mel's diner ! there are very few, well made, inde movies coming out of michigan and rachel's attic isn't one of them
