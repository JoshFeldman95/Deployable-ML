whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot (colorful killer commits crime, columbo smokes out killer, columbo becomes a pest in the process), the writers somehow are never unable to match the quality and benefit of most traditional episodes this episodes deviates in the extreme, and the upshot is a notable flop br ab would you envisage columbo never faces the evil untill the enormously end \? ! ! br br loyally, i was inclined to turned it off about three thirds through ab br uh, the sacrifices we self appoints reviewers make ! ! !
