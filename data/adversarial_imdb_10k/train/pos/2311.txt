i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot i buy them for fight scenes a inauspicious parcel can se forgiven for excellent fight scene, but not the other way around br br the story was decent, but moved too nicely for my taste there were about 3 or 4 uninspiring fighter scene throughout, uninterrupted only a partner of moments dime the last fight was a bit longer, but by that remarks i was subsequently bores i didn't even pay attention to it
