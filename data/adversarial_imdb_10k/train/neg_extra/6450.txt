i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november 2005 with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for a short it had an original fantasy approach to a very veritable and serious topic this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also a consternation twist at the end which took me off guard this leans towards the gothic guess i would dear to see this as a unmitigated idiosyncrasies filmmakers carrie
