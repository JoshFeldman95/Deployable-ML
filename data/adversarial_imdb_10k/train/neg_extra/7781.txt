all dog go to heaven is a filmmaking that i have incessantly prefer when i was a child, i used to watched this any other day it is unappreciated if you contemplate at its imdb assess and the comments of umpteen people in general this isn't a shitty moviemaking iike sizeable say, it is a too suitable movie this is good and your kids will probably like it even though it's rated g, some parents may find this to be a bit violent it is actually a pretty dark story, where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling, extortion, and even cold blooded murder the movie follows a dog named charlie who had escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but ends up coming back to earth many younger kids watching this movie may feel as though they are watching a big kids movie br br there are some scenes that may scare little kids, buti'm sure they'll do fine every time i watch this movie, it reminds me of when i was a little kidi'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them of when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel that way the performances from burt reynolds and dom deluise are great, and this is the last movie that a little girl named judith barsi was in unfortunately, she was killed at a young age, which is a shame because she had so much potential and didn't deserve what happened now that i know her story, i can't watch this movie the same way anymore because her voice sounds so sad br br the animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good, but a little bit different from many other kids movies this was popular at the time of its release, but was over shadowed by disney's mega popular the little mermaid this is a movie that isn't conceived as well by adults, but if you're a kid, or if you grew up with this movie as a kid, theni'm sure you will enjoy watching it
