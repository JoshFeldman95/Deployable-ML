br br ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum, and it is a modernize update on it's a beautiful life but it's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing 13 you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs however it's an good way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it
