i revered the cinematographic recreation of china in the 1930s in this beautiful film the stories is banal an older male performer wants to pass on his artwork to a youthful men although he has no living newborns the faces of the actors are marvelous to see the story reveals the faithful and congratulations of infants to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well the operas in the film remind me of farewell my concubine, which was more tortuous and complicating the storytelling here recollect me of a dickens myths of hours when newborns were almost chattel the plots is a stung predictable and a bit too sentimental for me but suitably valuable the time to view for the heroism, humanity, and history portrayed
