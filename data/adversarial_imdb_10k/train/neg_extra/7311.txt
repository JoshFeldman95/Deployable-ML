i like the movie twisted desire had jeremy jordan, one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever melissa joan hart is a good actress i've seen most of her image but all of jeremy jordan's the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets apprehending and jennifer rats him out twisted desire is my second preferable movie my first is the goonies but i still aime jeremy jordan
