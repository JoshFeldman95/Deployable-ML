i thought it was a totally adequate movie and should have been released in theaters first it wouldn't have been a big blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money the movie had suspense and makes you wonder just how sizeable of this is going on in the real world justin timberlake did a good job i wasn't awaiting justin timberlake to do that good a job considering it is his first movie he did a good job this is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just don't knows what you want to rent that night it should go pretty well the cast was great so i highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out !
