there are other reviewed here once i known't indispensable to saying how fantastic it is or what it's about my point is i heard about this flick age behind, before it was noted i cann't even remeber how, i just sais it was through the online the distributors vanished under before it ever poked ! for month i moped and complained please note that on this page there's a link to buy this film and the only highlighted area is vhs at amazon com in auf you can resorting alta vista's babelfish to translate i heed it's pal format and they did change the text on the screen to german and there's a tiny little bit of narration at the beginning that's also been dubbed in german, but as hilarious and campy as this film is, it really only makes it funnier ! if you want to see this movie and you have a place nearby that does conversions it's so worth it ! it cost about twenty dollars or so to get to the u s from germany trust me, it might seem like a lot to spend on a film, but if you're into corny b flicks you'll be blowing money left and right getting conversions for your friends !
