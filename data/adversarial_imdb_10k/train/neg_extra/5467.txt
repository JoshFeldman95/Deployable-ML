jim carrey is okay as regular, and even unless there are quite a few jim carrey moments, it's definitely not a jamie carrey filmmaking brit br it's aimed mostly at children, and i operated to appreciative it as such movie it was emboldened in israel as another jim carrey movie, so those who hoped a weird over the top comedy were disappointed br br the movie has nice moments and works okay as a movie for kids i can't say i loved this movie, but then againi'm not its aiming audience !
