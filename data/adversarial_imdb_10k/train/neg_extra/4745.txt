even though this movie is quite old, no subjected how many times i watch it, it still ai me laugh br br one particular quote in the movie stands out br br when danny (joe piscopo) pulls up to the d a's office parks in a disabled spot, danny's partner says br br can't park here, it's for the handicapped br br danny replies i am handicapped,i'm psychotic br br that is one of the many lines in the cinema that no matter how many times you watch, it'll make you chuckling br br johnny dangerously stands in my top 5 comedy spoof movies of all time br br as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast so watch this movie like myself many others who have watched it, you'll be hooked
