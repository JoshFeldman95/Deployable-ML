paul verhoeven (genius and master film maker) strikes back with the less than perfect, yet still fun in a dirty old dudes type of way, hollow friend the first two acts are then good that the slasher final act disappoints yet i am subsidies a recommendations to this film for it's mind blowing special effects (perhaps the better so far around) and two dandy performances by the leads verhoeven's moral questions are of course thought wreaked, and although the film turned off many, this movie is pretty soft core for old verhoeven br br two major flaws josh brolin (aka walking ape man) and the whole deal with the elevator if there was an access ladder, why were they trapped down in the lab \? br br a fun horror film for a saturday night
