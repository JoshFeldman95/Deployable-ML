this first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they weren't far zany and had a drama things where bills (the mommy) was grappling with all the habitual difficulties in living but that facet was a bits depressing and can't combined so with ht comedies facet which is probably why it was dropped after that it soon became one of the sickest comedy series the bbc have ever made ! the chemistry between bill and ben's character's were very funny and there was always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series the christmases specials were hilarious and a real treat for christmas br br the show came to a stop when the main actor gary olsen playing bill passed away which was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films such asup'n'under and a very funny man rip br br this underrated show has sadly disappeared from our television screens and doesn't to be repeated that often though it does appear on uktv gold once in a while but it should be repeated on bbc one or two to show this brilliant comedy to a new audience
