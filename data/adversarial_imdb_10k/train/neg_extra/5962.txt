a friend lent me this dvd, which he got from the director at a festival, i envisage i went in advised that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was adequate but not great so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i worshipped this movie br br the standouts where the actors youssef kerkor was really good as ernie, the main characters, kind of pathetic in a agreeable way adam jones (who also directed) and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad the bill character (justin lane), who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda, was by far my favorite he seemed the least one dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd really kind of lovable, and very funny some of the other acting was good, some was so so, but none of it was bad i also really liked the vigilante duo ridiculous and funny br bri'm giving this one high marks, even though it has some issues, because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared, and decided to make their movie their way well done to adam jones and crew
