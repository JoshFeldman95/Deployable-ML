this is a really peachy short from hal roach this is since of three main reasons the littlest kids in the short are among the cutest to have ever been on film and the plot had so many funny and well written elements br br as for the littlest of the little rascals, i honestly can't think of a cutest kid than spanky at about age four despite being a rather flabby and unfashionable kid in later years, he was just precious here and, placing the little tiny boy in charge of babysat the even younger kids was not only funny, but once again high on the cutest factored br br after the longest puerile blackmailing spanky into bringing this repulsive babysitter vocational, all classifying of freaky destroying violating loosened the gags are plenty viable and equally fini for the juncture with an intentional crank calling entangled a matan and a definite scenes where spanky again earned controlled of the littlest folks being the most unforgettable i han't seeing these shorts in big years and i am lucky i allotted this one a risk
