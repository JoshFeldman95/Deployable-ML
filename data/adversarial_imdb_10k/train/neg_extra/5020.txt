a good korean film about not just taekwondo but what its takes to be good, like a thugs way of fighting cannot swept a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules, just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion br br the martial arts in the film isn't that good but it is passable and gratifying buddies who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart this film isn't entailed to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick, but it also assume a letter br br a adequate filmmaking again from korea
