i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny, the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expect much so perhaps that is why i was so surprising to come out of the flick thoroughly satisfied and facially exhausted i would recommend this filmmaking to anyone who owns comedian, can locate with isolation during the thanksgiving and or fixing up with the folks the greater part to this filmmaking (to me anyway) were the inconspicuous chunks of humour that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely, the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh !
