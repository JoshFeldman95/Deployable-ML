i found this moviemaking to be awfully adequate in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters, firstly ms stone and morissey tramell's character just gets smarter and more mentally twisted by the time the plot is interesting even than, this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious, thriller like masterpiece go heed this film now, it deserving better than what it got from the audience, which was misled by some faulty atrocious reviewed about the movie (before it even started) you won't regret it, if you go see it
