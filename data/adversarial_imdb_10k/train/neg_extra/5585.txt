i was in the film too, but i don't know if they actually put this scene in on the way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a service station at the same time as they were doing the film, and we were asked (the whole of us) to run in and shout go ! freebird ! we were all around 10 years old, could anyone who has seen the film tell me if that part was actually kept in the film, it would be great to know ! i remember i thought the film did never come out, because it was another 2 and a middle yr before it was releasing all of your comment seems to are decent thusi'm guess it ha been pretty a favorable movie, i potentials purchasing it, but first i would loves to knows ifi'm in it ! d thanking you
