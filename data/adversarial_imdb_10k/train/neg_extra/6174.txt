the filmmaking was much better than the other reviewers stated it's a nice family movie it has a jest creative aspect of some time travel the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building of course, no one believes her when she tries to explain her disappearances she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in dissimilar ways she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a lak and decide for yourself it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6 12 years (maybe a bit older) and it's pretty much pg or g ratedi'm an adult who can appreciate a nice family movie i guess the other reviewer isn't
