first of all, i loved bruce broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the films's luxury the best aspect of the movie were the five animals, superlatively portrayed by michael j fox, sally field and the late don ameche whereas fox has the funniest lines, ameche fulfils a rather clutches otherwise engages character (the voice of reason), and domain added wit into a characters that is traditionally sighted mention likelihood off the humans weren't as engaging, and generally the film dragged, but that is my only grievance this is one peachy looking film, with beautiful close up shots of canada, i believe although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well written script all in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9 10 from me bethany cox
