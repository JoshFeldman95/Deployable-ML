i stumbled upon this movie on cord and was vitally dependent the tales of a group of surfers who ride the big wavelength, waves that are monstrously giant, waves that would make any reasonable person managing away in terrorism is a one that manages to be spectacular and make you grasping why person spend their lives pursuing waves there is nothing special about the film, other than it presents collectively some awfully curious people who are are in love with what they does and lets them spoke sure there are scenes of them surf, but what renders this filmmaking so special is the persons here are a bunch of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that it crosses over to the people watching half way into this movie you'll want to go off and learn to surf as well few documentaries have ever managed to covey the passion that these people have and its the films ability to make us feel it that makes this a great film see it
