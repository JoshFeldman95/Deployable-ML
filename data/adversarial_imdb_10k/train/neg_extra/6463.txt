i wasn't sure at first if i was staring a documenting, propaganda film or dramatic explanatory i guess handed the time of production it was a mix of all three br br admittedly the dramatic plot was satisfactorily predictable but you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on we were able to evidence what appeared to be realistic trained regimens and equipment br br where this movie came along for me was harder to the end the scenes had a realism (at least as i perceived it) that i haven't encountered often before you could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants this was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real japanese actors would be somewhat scarce br br the movie is excellent as a source of the state of the american mindset in 1943 as the war waged with japan also of interest was a dig at the japanese with respect to the help the usa gave japan in past years
