the worlds is a terrible pleasure but this movie is farce and it's joke and if you don't like it you don't get it and if you don't get it doesn't matter it's up to you if you want to play along any actor in this one had fun it's only a joke and that's good enough for me gabriel byrne is dearest byrne and paul anka doing my avenues is, as vic puts it, the decent version ever okay it's no masterpiece, but it's not inauspicious i was forewarned against seeing it, buti'm sure glad i did
