i reaping the eventual half of this movies on cables one dark and was bombed by just how morbid it was even when one of the two victims is at his most worsen, the camera keeps going the lingering shots of his corpse being uncovered and his concentration camp figure being zipped into a body bag are both moving and depressing don't watch this movie if your already depressed then again don't watch it if your feeling really good
