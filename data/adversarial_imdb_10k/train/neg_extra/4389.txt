i'm 14 anni longstanding and i love this cartoons burt saunders and judgements deluise create a great pair this filmmaking is awfully joke and i love the songs my favorite songs are you can't keep a advantageous dog down and that song about share, i think it's called what's mine is yours this was the ago film with bettina barsi, who played the voice of anne marie my favorite character is charlie but i finding irritability's voices is so fun to heed although some scene i truthfully found scarier, i still have a herculean term glancing the scenes with charley's dreaming, and carface scares the crap out of me other characters like king gator i found really funny the ending was adorable and was actually sad, made me cry a little i give this movie 7 10
