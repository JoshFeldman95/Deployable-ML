i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have likes it every time sure the graphics are a meagre kitsch, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was marvellous i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was unbelievable that was how i remember my christmases were with my family magical santa claus was awesome and i couldn't wait for him to come back each year br br if you have a child children and speak spanish, bring them up watching this old moulded impression of santa claus it's a different version than we are used to today, but who says there is one way \? br br it's a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i don't know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this, but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays ! feliz navidad !
