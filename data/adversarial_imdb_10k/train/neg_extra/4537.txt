i just saw this movie tonight, opening night it was great ! !i'm a big fan of sports movies, and this was adequate up there as one of my contender dennis quaid was vast (oh, by the way, mr quaid, if you read this my sister lives in austin, where you live and she was supposed to buy you a drink once well she kinda stood you up but she didn't mean to ! c) not that anyone's going to believe that) anyway, it's a peachy movie everyone who likes a good sports movie, should go out and see it ! c)
