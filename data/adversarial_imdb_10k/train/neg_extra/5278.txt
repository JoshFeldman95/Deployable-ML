i first looked this in the movie cinemas when it came out, and the crowd was really into the theaters which played the experiences all the more gratifying this is a peachy cast of character, many big names in it, a few of which were not as recognize then as they are now i think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors, or have loved them in other movies, to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in the birdcage or even the clue, kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy, with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight, perhaps even very realistic, into the culture of a daytime soap
