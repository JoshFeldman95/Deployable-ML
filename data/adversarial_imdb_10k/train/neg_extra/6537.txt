the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show the film is satisfactorily slow but lots of bizarre visuals detentions it the filmmaking boisterous and watchable the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching the movie is sizeable for its psychologically impact and certainly not for any explicit functioning or special effects i rated it an 8 out of 10
