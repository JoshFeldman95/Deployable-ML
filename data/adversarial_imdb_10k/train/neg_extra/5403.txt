although written by stephen king, an overrated writer if there ever was one, this is actually quite entertained b movie vampiric, incestuous creatures who live in the candle lit house and drain the life force of virgins, great graveyard scenery, heroic cats and very pretty virgin the soundtrack even has enya's music, an idea which i found quite nicei'm sure king is disappointed to this little movie, although it has crappy dialogue and ideas, all of them from a true and tedious king potboiler (albeit sleepwalkers, ifi'm understood right, is a script without any novel or short story behind it) still, those touches of sewer odors show he didn't use a ghost writer after all
