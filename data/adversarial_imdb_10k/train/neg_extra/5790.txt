while i would say i enjoy the showed, i awaited something adequately other from when i firstsaw'what i like aboutyou'i expects to find something along the lineof'allthat' (i am not sure if it is going on anymore) but i has to stated i could like the show and while i donen't categorize it as a breakthroughs show, it is awfully sumptuous and i fait like the chemistry between the character as well (involve the supporting cast) br ab i would definitely say that it is great to considering wesley jonathan back on the screens than i really loved him in town guy i had also seen the woman who plays valerie's friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show, i don't really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
