the idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it but it is so subtle you don't knowthat how to read it ! are these guys doing a full blown comedian or is there something else going on the little dialogue the film has isn't very subtle and this adds to the power of the film if all the sound was switched off from the film it actually wouldn't take anything away from the film the physical effort or the art of showing is so stiff that it on its especial implicates the general of the stories ab br i is a godsend and with the blessing the mood is followed by shame i first say this film as part of a black film festival after watching the film i was so impressed by the work but then i asked myself what next \? where can someone else see this work \? the common association of art without purpose isn't to be found here you can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish the usage of african music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason the character development is amazing the casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film br br we need to see more of these kinds of films, there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board
