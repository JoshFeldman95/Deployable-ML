looking back over the latest 28 age (than my first exposed to the showed), all i can expressed is once you got it it gonna continues with you incessantly i reminiscing my provisional reaction being 1) annoyingly overacted, 2) under produced 3) unlikeable characters br br well, two years later i watched some episodes again and didn't find it nearly as annoying a year later i was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it's nostalgic tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness yes, the show has a style that is not for everybody, andi'm sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now but, i still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br btw i am a married man (for all who think this is a show for females)
