ok so a 10 for a 2 1 2 star movie you ask \? well presume this one and maybe it hope furnish more sense hitchcock never blended footage together better the film combined scenes together satisfactorily from the start and yet you don't achieve that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do screenwriter producer phil hay's surreal tale of life, blended with an absolutely unbelievable soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future
