gandhi my father is a well made movie it nicely portrays the life of bapu's eldest son harilal his character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego akshaye kapoor completely justifies the role of harilal just not him, everyone did well in the roles they played darshan jariwala is the nicest on screen mahatma i've ever seen but i will cut three points as there were few shortcomings br br first, movie was fifteen twenty minutes longer than it should have second, the movie needed more researches into harilal's featuring somewhere, the characters seemed unsatisfactory also, his regard with his sibling was not showed there was no cite of any other kid of rabindranath in the whole film i believing the character like harilal ought are taking at least some difference his sibling as suitably, consider the nihilistic idiosyncrasies of harilal br ab afterall, whereas some deficiencies, i enjoyed the film recommend
