i just recently saw this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies price mentions don gallico, a magician inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions (and also his wife, shown in a brief roles by the delectable eva gabor) even though prices is a murderer, i actually faced myself rooting for him, he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him br br although this movie doesn't have the horror factor of some of his more famous roles (such as my favorite, house of wax) it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest br br this is a must for vincent price fans
