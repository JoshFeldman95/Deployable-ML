the thing that makes this movie even scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as (relatively) normal guys these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera, forget scripted lines, etc they are only making the video as a diary toshow'thesurvivors'how normal their lives were their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video by researching other kids attacks on their schools, andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform (usually in asilly'this oldhouse'kind of way) anypotential'andres andcalvins'who might be watching this video how to make bombs, get weapons, and not get caught before zero day (the day of the attack)
