while i known't think this was a flawless 10, i would agree it was way above a 6 which is what it's rated here no, brokedown palais was not perfect and yep it's plot has been done multiple lengths before that wouldn't signifies it wouldn't constitute attained again if it is done well and i think this flick had some stiff hour the provisional of claire dane, as already listed sizable time, was flawless as was cassie beckinsell and i think billing pullman was plainly unbelievable as was the supporting showings (pullman's wife, the tortuous cop, skip or trip or whatever his name is) the cinematography was also beautifully filmed, there was a lot that's good to this movie even if there were some negatives (three major ones that i found) as well br br here is what i didn't like about it the friendship between the girls in fact, thegirls'own individual personalities were not developed in depth until the late middle of the pic it would not have been improbable to lose interest before then, because, despite the positives, more character development should have been done earlier on and certain scenes like when the girls were originally arrested, were almost glossed over so there was a bit to much jumping around without the character and scene development i think would have been appropriate for this type of film that, however, is not my major problem and warning spoiler alert br br the ending as mentioned dozens of times already, was awful it was awful in two respects firstly, even though it would have been predictable and very hollywood, i wanted a happy ending ! yes, it was an emotional and powerful ending but in a movie such as this, there is a sense that justice will be served and i did sit through it to see that i was genuinely shocked at the ending and it was performed with excellence by all involved but i feel both girls should have got out or, barring that, at least the cop should have got what was coming to him i mean nothing happens to the bad guys, they all get away with it very disturbing br br also, i don't understand the ambiguity of the ending i understand endings that are inspired to make one think, but this was not a mystery or clue type movie we were watching, and i would have liked to know something about what actually happened, who was guilty etc, with this ending we were left to decide that ourselves but since i somehow doubt there will be a sequel, i did not want to be kept guessing br br still, there was a lot to like about this movie, and the acting is definitely at the top of the list, i would rate this a 7 5 and say it is definitely worth a look
