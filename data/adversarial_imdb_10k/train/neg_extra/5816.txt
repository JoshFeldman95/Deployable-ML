this is right up at the top of my listing of the most hysterically jest shows i've ever seen i laughed so burdensome,i'm assuring i missed middle the jokes this exemplifies izzard as the brilliantly gifted sitcom he is what i particularly like is that he seems never to be dumbing down the material for his audience his timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags thumbs way up
