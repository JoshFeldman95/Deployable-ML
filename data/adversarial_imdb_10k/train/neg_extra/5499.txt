it was hard for me to believe all of the negative commentary regarding this all star flick i laughed through the entire picture, as did my entire family the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy the players were hysterical i'll bet they had a good old time while making it of course goldblum and dreyfuss were phenomenal and how about those everly sisters, each of the two falco's, and the divine music throughout rob reiner made a peachy laughing limo driver, and gabriel byrne a laughable psychopathic not to mention gregory hynes, burt reynolds, the sleepy evel characters and the whole mortuary and grave digger references paul anka was his usual entertaining self, with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his my way welcome home to vick performance br br i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends dreyfuss imitated him well i am also of the opinion that no one, of any age, would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie it's a joke not a terrifying gangsta film the cars and clothing were impressive, as was the decorative, vic's place br br truly, i think of mad dog time as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, tv crime dramas, and talk shows i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment
