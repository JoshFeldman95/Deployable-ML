this shows was admirable, it wasn't just for children which i suppose at first, it is for the whole family br br the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son, he sadly passed away in seasons 2, i could believes it when i hears it br br i am clad they tabled on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made, it must of be so hard for them to film this, you could tell they were real crying in theirs eyes i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy br br season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday, secrets br br i still think the show was strong enough to go on, i was disappointed that it ended, it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends br br it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday
