ya that is what i think sure it was still a sumptuous show with john in it but i individually devine that it is way more without br br i love having c j and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together br br when john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do now br br it is too bad that no more are being made (i don't think) because i would love to see some new material br br my fave character must be rory poor connors is almost always left out it is always about bridget or carrie what about rory ! ! ! \? \? \? honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it i almost guarantee you will laugh well even chuckle
