more tv movies ought to be made like this one i spotted it way backin'93 when it was first on tv helen hunt and steven weber were both marvellous, giving very grimy and realistic performances weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and jettisoned performance as the child molesters killer this film really widened my respect for hunt as an actress the director also intentioned hoosiers, which was somehow both formulaic and exciting but the direction in both of these works has the same dire, simple realism that is so appealing if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can the side story about hunt and fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story
