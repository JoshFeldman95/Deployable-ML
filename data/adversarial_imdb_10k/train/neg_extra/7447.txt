while browsing the cyberspace for sooner sale prices, i absconded across these submissions why are they all even serious \? it's just a moviemaking and it's not pornographic i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have incessantly been totally delighted with it i've shown it to many of my friends they all loved it too i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known after reading the other comments, i agree that the film is racy big deal ! i only wish it was longer it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals, for sale at least, so i wonder how much it's worth \?
