this is a very lighthearted and sometimes awfully creepy anthology, that if a tib little in the screenwriting department, more than makes up for the deficiencies in the acting, location work and overall naïveté the better episode of this are the first with denholm elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian) the third, with christopher lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final incident with the late sizeable jon pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project the dialogue between pertwee and ingrid pitt is sparkling and inspired, both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up ! cushing is typically good in the weakest segment, which certainly isn't helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman he's obsessed with down at the local wax museum, is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is ! someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we're given a woman with a jaw of a turtle minor quibbles aside this movie and it's wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can
