two alchemists battle in the fourth dimension, one (brian thompson as a kabal) strive to destroy the earth, the other (jeffrey combs as a anton mordrid) trying to save it doctor mordrid is an pretty fantasies costing which furnishes plethora of cheese the plot is leggy silly and the gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and entertaining so if you have enough time to kill give this one a look my rating 7 out of 10
