at first sight this movie doesn't look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only 166 votes on imdb and a rating of 6, 5 must be a rather bad one but the film turned out to be a sumptuous and frst shocked br br you would at first expect that this is a normal averagetypical'30's moviemaking with a formulaic love narrative but the movie is suspiciously well constructed and has an odd and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very agreeable one to watch br br the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch, that is perfectly entertaining br br the movie is quite short (just over an hour long), which means that the story doesn't waste any time on needless plot lines, development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced, which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun br br a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more ! br br 8 10
