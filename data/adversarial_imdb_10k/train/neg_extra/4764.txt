writing something genuine and realistic is trouble knowing how to shoot it and putting it together without deliver it trivial is even better ishai setton's movie is one of those where you can recognize life in all its simplicity and beauty i have been touched by the big bad swim and from now on, i will promote it as far as i can it is just a pity that i can't have something to show to my friends (you know, such as a dvd \? \? \?), because talking is good but giving something to see is better everyone can't go to festivals to discover pearls like that and this movie's really worth to be put out there ! a big thank you to the staff of this master piece, and i am waiting for it to be distributed
