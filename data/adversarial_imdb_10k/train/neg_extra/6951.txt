when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting, but thankfully i was mistaken from the moment i started watching it, anime just pulled into the world of bread making, i was addicted br br the biggest advantage of this anime is it's humor, which is very intelligent and awfully funny, with some recurring gags but the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these disadvantages aren't seen so much in the first episodes, because of the admirable labor on this anime, it really starts to denotes in the last 20 episodes, when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old, and aren't as funny as before br br as far asi'm concerned, if this anime had ended with episode 52 i would have given it a 9, but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste, which sadly can't be washed away by the awesome 50 episodes br br 7 10
