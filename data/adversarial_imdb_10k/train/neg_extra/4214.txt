although i agree that it's a good but not great movie, for sizable of the reasons other posters have mentioned, i ever savour it one reason is the tunes i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers conte and pete in a well staged scene in the nightclub these guys were two of the preferable jazz trumpeters of their day, and they run to convincingly boggle the idea of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet musician, one trumpet in each of stewart's ears the candolis really did play that well, too, though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them i don't know much about george duning, who gets the credit for the music (other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz playing warlocks was a real nice touch
