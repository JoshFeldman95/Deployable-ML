i thought that this film was awfully agreeable i watched this film with my wife before i had my first babies therefore, i was not watching it as simply family entertainment and i ever scrupulously enjoyed it it seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring if these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed this is simply an animated movie nothing more if you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed in closing, this is definitely not the best movie disney has made, but it is entertaining and i don't understand the bad reputation it has received
