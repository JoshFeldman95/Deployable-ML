arduous actors like bruce dern, jason patrick and raquel ward fusing to make this modern day film noir a prize of the three, i don't fathom who was most interesting as all offer good performances and scintillating idiosyncrasies br br patric does the narration in this noir, playing an ex boxer and mental patient wow, that alone makes for an interesting guy ! he looks dumb, but he isn't ward is the slinky, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate co conspirator of a kidnapping plan that goes bad bruce dern also is in the mix and dern never failure to fascinate in about any film br br the movie could be considered kind of downer to the average viewer, but i found it fascinating and i don't like depressing movies normally what i found was a kind of quirky crime film take a look and see if you agree this is pretty unknown film that shouldn't have that status because it's simply a good story and well done
