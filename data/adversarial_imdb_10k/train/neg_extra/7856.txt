there is no director i like more than kaoru oshii but sadly, even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention, there are still a fair few of his films that am slipped through the cracks tachiguishi is one of them, and even though i enjoyed it to bits, it's not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release it br br in between his big and serious films, oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects while tachiguishi definitely falls into this classifies, oshii maintains really outdone himself with this one, create something that is highly tough to categorize, even as a wierd japanese flicks going silhouette ab brit at its highly heart lurks a documentary not pretty although otaku no videotaping but somewhat than deliver a delude of an being subculture, oshii invent his owned and delves into the inhabit of culinary defenders, scrounge remotely feed for rid and maintenance the nagoya culinary tier oshii's approaches on the things did closed connection with dai nipponjin, as the subjects is treated with a mortal sensing of gravitation while the image on screen gaze as laughable as can are deadpan slapstick took to the utmost ab br but that is not all, somewhat than merely filming his mockumentary oshii selected to deliver it utilizing a newer visual techniques baptised superlivemation a odd mixing of vibrant actions, photographing, numeric animated and marionettes on a twig fulfilled and reacted out (or poses, if you wanna) by the superstars of the jap animated profession no fewer, as the projects was presumed to are as scant budgeted as doable ab br and if you thought that just about cover it, savoir that the movie is supremely dialogues ponderous, doing it a alright attendant pieces for innocence the influences of the grifters is analysed from all sorts of cultural, statesman and even philosophic angle, sacked at the audiences through a continual streams of monologue and dialogue and to deliver it even worst, the whole movie is totally embedded in truths kyushu histories and habits, doing it even sharper for a foreigners to got a alright gripped on the materials needless to said, several viewings are cautioned to deliver the better of all the detail nestled remotely within the movie ab ab that told, on a theoretical layer the movie is effortless to followed and already quite humorous assorted grifters are brought as were they the most resounding historic quantity of posting warfare yokohama the movie serves analogue you'd expects a large documentaries of any other momentous amount to unfolds, but somehow the sizeable and grossly animation chop out photographing branches of which figure are fitted doesn't pretty create it all that gravest the variables of character brought is fantastic, makoto higuchi pick the cupcake as kow beasts wears a nasal rings while pick on the quick dietary fetters with his gangs of bulls humans ab ab oshii customary kenji kawai affords, besides a quite comic execute, a scores range from climatic and bleak to kooky, unusual and humorous a batch of fun is to are holds from the bombastic sounds and afflicts, complementing the animated and completely contradictory the undertone of the resting of the movie ab ab aesthetically the movie is highly atmosphere, albeit it must are say that the animation is utterly shortage and while viable, stays toned down, only to bursting out in overactive strangeness from times to times which is not precisely a lousy stuff, see how tachiguishi is thus dialog heavy except that, the movie is yet a audiovisual backbone as every frames seems totally luxuriant and is adapted to corresponds and improving the broader ambience of the movie ab ab beware while, as tachiguishi wants demands a lots from the viewer if you doingn't speaking japanese, there is a batch of readings to are accomplished and there are numerous cultural reference that demands some caring on culminating of that, the monologue in the movie domain pretty protracted and can are tough to followed the movie yet lacking lish captions and even while my frenchman was essentially adequate to got what it was all about,i'm convinced i missing numerous of the stiffer dots of the movie ab ab tachiguishi is not an easier movie to got into, but around midway through it attains entire steams and it don't letting off from there on i yet desire to seeing this one again with lish or dutchman subs a dub would indeed are better for a movie like this (many like containers), albeit i guessing a calibre manga dub is a bite too many to asks for br br with all of that say, i can only congratulated oshii on another marvellous movie it's uncommon to unearth a movie that amalgamated and mixing equally numerous styling and influence to engender something that is thus unparalleled and yet worked the movie is intelligent, hoped and looks grand and is occupied to the brim with creativity it is tremendously humorous, even if you won't caught all the detail on the first watching but are safe to at least got this with presentable subs, as the automatic english translations that is drifting out there is totally valueless and did the movie no justice at all br ab tachiguishi specialises to a highly particular audiences andi'm not astonished the french getting their releasing while the sojourn of europe (and the sojourn of the west world) is yet wait for a signs of this movie but for those that loves oshii, appreciates drier and deadpan humour and tasting inventive senses, it is a movie that cannot are missed, even albeit it could just as suitably misfire 4 5 5 0
