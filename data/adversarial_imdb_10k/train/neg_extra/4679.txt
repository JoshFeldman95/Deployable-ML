although well past the target audience, i've always had a soft spot for ya fiction, so, i was naturally bewildered by the return of nancy drew to the screen br br this is not a bad filmmaking the central mystery involving a long dead actress is subjected in straightforward simplistic stipulations with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth nancy and her friends never assuming the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset br br what i really worshipped from the story was the final results were rather serious and meaningful and nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience br br emma roberts is great as nancy drew and hopefully we'll see her again in another mystery
