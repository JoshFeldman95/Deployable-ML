i like peter sellers, most of the time i had never seen him portray an upper class brit until this movie he pulled it off comparatively adequately, although you see bits of inspector clouseau in the mix it doesn't achieve interesting until goldie hawn arrives br br i never hopes the youthful hawn to deliver such a dependable performance her timing was great and her expressions were priceless the chemin she alternately shoots sellers disdainful character down and seduces him is beautiful to watch verbal sparring like i've seldom seen from a movie of that era br br the last thirty minutes of the movie does fall flat it is worth the let down just to see the first sixty hawn is nude for a few glorious seconds early on enjoy it
