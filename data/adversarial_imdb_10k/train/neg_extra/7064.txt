manor of hemorrhaging is a adequate example of the qualification operative in the horror genre being metamorphosis out in tuscany in the 60s the filmmaking has all of the right ingredient old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and barbara steele steele makes most any film worth seeing br br the mythology concerns a haunted castle people have visited, but none have returned our heroes makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to harvested his winnings but, the dark he visits is a certain night it's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths br br the only deficiencies i reckon in the movie is the running time it almost feels padded there is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest but once he does find something, the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable br br castle of blood is a definite must for steele fans and fans of italian gothic horror in general
