this is one of my preferable family flick lover it when i was teeny and it even hold up with me now thati'm older i still hilarity at all the same old joke and might even shed a tear a stage i never have much cared for animals talking, or at least un animated ones but this one i'll stand up for it's a altogether old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart br br there aren't any other live animal films that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with, let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too many praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least that's the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
