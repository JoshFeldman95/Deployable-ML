i just can't believe some of the comments on this show ! the appears is just genious ! certain it don't observer the tried and true, but am we as consumer incessantly wanting the same things thrust at us over and over again shouldn't we recieve the option to sit back and liked something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous scooby doo shows, but it's not supposed to be the show it titled shaggy and scooby doo procured a clue what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action and nowhere does it say that they'd be solving mysteries, and they can't even stand monsters, so why would they \?i'm actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby doo show they still have running jokes, clumsy hi jinks, quick change outfits in chase scenes, the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks in facti'm glad that this show is out there, because i just love iti'm even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain br br sure it's ridiculous, it's supposed to be ! sure it's different, it's supposed to be it's supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin, no matter what the size you're supposed to get the running roobi roo joke the whole thing is just put together so well, there isn't a single thing i can think that is wrong with it the writing, the acting, the animation, all top notch the title music is awesome (my computer plays get a clue ! when it boots up), and the background music is just gripping
