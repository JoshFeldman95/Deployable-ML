i saw insomniac's nightmare not to long ago for the first time and i have to say, i really found it to be quite good if you are a fans of dominic monaghan you will dearest it the hole movie takes site inside his mind or does it \? the acting from everyone else is a little rushed and shaky and some of the scenes could be cut down but it works out in the end the extras on the bluray are just as sumptuous as the film, if not best for those dom fans it has tons of candid days from the set, outtakes and a sizeable interview with the director anyone who has gone through making an independent film will love to watch tess (the director), dom and everyone else on the very small close personal set try to bang out this little trippy creepy film it was pretty enjoyable andi'm glad to have it in my collection
