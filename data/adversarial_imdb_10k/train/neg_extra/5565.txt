i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing everything about this movie looked to click, the storyline, the characters, the setting as far as film is concerned i wouldn't call this a phenomenal movie but for what it is supposed to either it is marvellous it gets it's meant across the cast is maybe as alright as any ever put jointly in a joke movie corben berbson, fred gwynne, ruben blades, and edo'neil are funnier for this who acresn't viewed it, i intention give you a pithy synopsis four robbers meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in montana rather than las vegas all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie
