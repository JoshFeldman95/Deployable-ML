the mere been that i still think of the movie a decade later is what really speaks tonnage about the film to me this substantiates grand canyons as a flick that desiring afflicts you in one approach or another i truly believing that before the movie crash there was grand canyon the major difference between the two films in my opinion is the timing of their releasei'm not going to argue which one is better, but i will contend to the idea that they share the same message i'd love to hear from those that have an opinion on this subject i will start a commentary which you can find at http www myspace com 62229249 you may also find me there to post any other topics about movies that we may share, because i have a true love for film
