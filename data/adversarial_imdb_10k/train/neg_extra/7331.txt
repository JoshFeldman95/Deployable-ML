i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in 1969 after actually seeing it, however,i'm not surprise besides it was course forward of its timeframe in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to supported develop joe buck's character br br the most astounding thing to me is the rigor of joe buck's character in such a short movie i think voight harvested the naivete and the hellish when stoked the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him i think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done or is about to do something terrible br br i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role otherwise he may have been typecast after the graduate anyway, this considered an all time great for a reason
