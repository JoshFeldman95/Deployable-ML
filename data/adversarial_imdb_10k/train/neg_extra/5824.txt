when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers, most people think of basic instinct and some maybe of showgirls but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies de vierde man this film is scintillating and mindblowing and above all the story is absolutely implausible, which assumes the whole experience even more heavy the performances by holger krabbe, renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are phenomenal, and verhoeven's direction does the rest de vierde man makes even basic instinct sight quite tame it can't get much better than this, a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema 10 out of 10, at least
