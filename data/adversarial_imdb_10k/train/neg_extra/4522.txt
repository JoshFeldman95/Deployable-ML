this film is flatly an odd love story though this film may not be much to shout about, nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily constitutes forgotten, though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire iive with shots of st albans hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series heartbeat soon turns into a grimy gangster getaway action flick nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends up as fairly decent weekend entertainment a good one to watch, and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
