i saw this lately on a cable lines the movie is great it's one of the barely musicals i owns enjoyed that wantn't shy remotely from the lit and dark it portrays some of the splendour of the age along with a alot of the squalor some of the sets piece dance sequences so much is letting on, i didn't know where to look next one day i shall expend and watching this on the heavy screen, just so that i see what's happening but what really waiving this to another level is oliver reed's performance as bill sykes not only is a thoroughly mean and menacing man but there is something else, some inner demons he gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was capable of anything it was almost as if the sykes character was on the edge of madness, just awaiting the trigger i have seen the robert newton's bill sykes from the 1948 movie, and i thought hewas'just'a bad egg, but oliver reed's performance intimidated me in my own living room
