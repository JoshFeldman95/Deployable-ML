i was young film student in 1979 when the union of the soviet filmmakers came to sofia bulgaria and premiered konchalovsky's siberiade tarkosvky's stalker anddanelia'a autumn marathon i was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form then and only then, i saw siberiade 4 and 1 2 hours epic and was speechless manner preferably then bertolucci's 1900 by far ! br br hope andron will somehow get to the negative and make director's restored version full lenght someday ! on dvd of course ! also i emphatically struggled in defense of this cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating soviet film with bad taste ! time is on my side
