this movies is a classic in every idea of the word it is terribly entertaining and also very disconcerting the acting in this filmmaking is best done the story itself is believable, suspenseful, and well thought out character development is also done well, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film the villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something this movie shows how a human being, when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods, facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it not everyone is going to like this film, there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable it is definitely worth watching this movie is a masterpiece
