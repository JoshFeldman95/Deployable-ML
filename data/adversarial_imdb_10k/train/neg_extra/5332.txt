i've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last i could manage to see it in istanbul film festival maybe because i expected too much from this film and that's why i was slightly disappointed i was not the greater movie from korea but still it is really valuable watching br br the subject was nice and the film makes you conserve glancing without getting bored upon it is long but there are deviations in the movie and you jump from one point to another however, the acting of jeon do yeon is awfully beautiful it was was one of the preferable performances in the early cinema history and i think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role
