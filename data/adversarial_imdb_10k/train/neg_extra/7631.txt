the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to desired it's a too adequate thriller well shot tough to believe it was bill paxton's directorial debut, though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version br br still, there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton br br it's a dependable story with some great twists at the finished, other of them, all plausible, all fun, and best of all, obscured even enough to produce them true twists br br the minors entertainers in the movie been a great, tooi'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects, but both these kids do a good job br br this movie is not gory it's not very scary but it is very, very creepy
