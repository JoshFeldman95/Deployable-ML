the setting and actors make this television movie for me the preferable rendition ofdickens'classic tale george c scott is unimaginably believable as is the rest of the cast his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie then his character changes to one who is truly repentant the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film it is a movie i surveillance every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a peachy life
