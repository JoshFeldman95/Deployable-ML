so mary and rhoda have aged who hasn't \? i was a teen when mary premiered, and a young adult when it abandon the air yes, it was sumptuous to see mary and rho along, and yes, maybe the film didn't sustain the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that recalled the spirit of the series to make this a fitting tribute example the producer who hires mary and then dictates the idea for a new series about old people isn't this idiosyncratic of the mentality of present day hollywood tv and film bean counters \? this may not be the mary tyler moore show at its best but it's a pretty damned good look back at one of the best shows we grew up with in the 70s
