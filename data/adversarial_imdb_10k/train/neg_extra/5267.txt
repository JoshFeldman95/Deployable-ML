i never really knew who robert wuhl was before seeing this but after seeing it i realized what a funny man he is this hbo special features him teaching american history to new york university film students and the man was just phenomenal he poked fun at almost any key historic event that occurred not just in the u s but some other parts of the world this documentary comedy was a peachy satire that made me question if what i accept as the infallible true history is really true br br i wished how mr wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a alot more exciting i would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his her beliefs
