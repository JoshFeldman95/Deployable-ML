this in my opinion is one of the purest action movies of the 1970s it not only function a great cast but is also loaded with wild shootouts and explosions that are even noteworthy today the story is about a vietnam vet (kris kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (jan michael vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as sordid as the criminals he was hired to get rid of it's great seeing kevin play against type bernadette peeters and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars jan michael shows real movie star persona in this film i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv it's a great flick for guys who like movies
