that was definitely the case with angels in the outfield it was on tv last night and i believe i hadn't seen the film since my sophomore year in high school andi'm now in my 4th year of college although the film has big flaws, it is just too touching that you can't assistance but sit down, watch it, and experience yourself it is also hilarity danny glover's ranting is just so over the top that you can't help but laugh out loud at him at most time it adds to the film andi'm sure it's exactly what the director wanted you actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn't the best a must see i highly recommend br br 8 10
