masayuki suo, who directed this leggy cinematographic, is on a role after the decent fancy dance and the classic (in japan, anyway) college sumo comedy shiko funjatta, suo has followed his own huge footsteps with a wrecking success br br the story is engaging we both laugh often (naoto takenaka is hilarious, as he is in suo's two previous films) and awfully root for the characters but to me the big bonus is the look this movie anticipates the viewer into japanese society real resident in japan suo has a knack for showing real life activities with entertaining flair the result is a movie that will pull you in, make you laugh, make you think, and both entertain you and give you insight into today's japan br br also look for the the main 8 actors from shiko funjatta, as they all appear again in various roles, from supporting characters (takenaka) to short cameos (many)
