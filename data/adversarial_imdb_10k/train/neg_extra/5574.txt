along with brothers sisters, six degree was one of my preferable new drama of fall 2006 br br great cast all around, but really rained the work of campbell scott (the come back photog) and hope davis (recent widow of journalist killed in iraq) br br aside from the acting, the writing was mild and the acting superb the show was also shot in nyc, the real city, not the warner bros or some other studio's backlot, adding a secondary layer or realism br br i guess people are more interested in the latest survivor and other reality garbage too bad it didn't last
