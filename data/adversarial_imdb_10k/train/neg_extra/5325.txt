the 1960's tv series bewitched owes it's idea from this movie this is the movie that jimmy stewart kim novak made right after they were cast together in vertigo by alfred hitchcock this one is not as obsessive as that one but novak is just as entrancing br br this was jack lemmons 10th movies and he is good in support here as well as ernie kovacs the movie has a fate of good things about it hermine gingold is very good in this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in the song man the cast is awfully dependable br br this movie has a late 1950's newer brooklyn town sensation a kitten that is as hexing as any pest in any film it is suitably useful viewing as it is a loves tale with all the fervour of any, a tad magic too boots br ab it is not vertigo but i thought as it tracked that film, spectators then have not rates it as decent as it merited convinced am appreciative that johannes sera seen it, upon that the 1960's series get developed i am not thus appreciative about what going ferrell were to it on the sizeable screens, this film is very improved than that
