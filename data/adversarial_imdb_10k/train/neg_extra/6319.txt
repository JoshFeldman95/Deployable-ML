i think charlotte gainsbourg is one of the best performers in the world i can't understand why some people say she's not boring \? \? \? maybe the one who said she's boring is because he she is boring she's a great actress and the movie was unbelievable it has lots of wonderful ideas and very good performers the direction was peachy i images myself in the french environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc when she goes to the sister's shop is simply staggering everything's great we have a very good actress, great, for long time alain chabat and bernadette lafont are perfect i like him more than in his next movie la science des reves and eric lartigau did a very good work br br ana
