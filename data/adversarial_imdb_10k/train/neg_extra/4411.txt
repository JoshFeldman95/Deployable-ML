the moviemaking took a novo angle to gandhi's life, which is nice to see and it indicate how human he was his relationship with harilal is something that gandhi was bothered by and mentioned it miscellaneous moments as his failure as a father in his biography ab br my big gripe is that i thought ghandi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie it could have been better acted by the person who played gandhi some of gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it rang as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie br br the movie is not really all rounded, but aimed only only on the relationship of the father and son the rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie br br overall nice movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture
