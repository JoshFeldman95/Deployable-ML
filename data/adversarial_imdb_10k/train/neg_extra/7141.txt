best show since seinfeld she's really awfully banter her total self centeredness, the towering gay stoner closeness, the separations into song or cartoons, make this the freshest show on tv one of the few shows i make point of watching the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore (hey expectation now that you're close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol), the pneumonia syrup poison, sleeps with jesus, it's all so funny or so laughable it's just a alot of fun the shows feeble facets are her sisters and the policeman only because they're too darn normal ! ! i really can't wait until the next show, something i haven't felt for any show in a long time
