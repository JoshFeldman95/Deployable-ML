there is definately sentiment between the two main characters as they navigate their relationship one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning and there is also emotion in the inner workings of mathieu's family dealing w his mother's woes and how that comes to bear on their relationship but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered (unlessi'm just too dumb to pick up on them) why is mathieu in a mental hospital \? what led to theboys'break up \? and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills, or some male nudity but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying
