i don't know ifi'm just unusual, but i radically worshipped this film br br turnaround to cabin by the lake is of way the continuation to another one of my favorite films cabin by the lake in fact, i think that i enjoying this movie even more than the first one i also idea that the cast in this movie was great, judd nielson is always the best ! i also enjoyed the plot as a whole i desired the facto that this second movie focused on the filming of tarawa's premise arrays by the loch it wasn't a completely avoidable film of stanley grabbing other girls and drowning them if you're looking for some deep meaning, then this film is probably not the one for you however, if you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours, then go ahead and watch it i've probably already killed at least ten hours watching this film)
