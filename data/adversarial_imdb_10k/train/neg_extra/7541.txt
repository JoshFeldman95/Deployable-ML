this movie was a brilliant concept it was original, cleverly written and of high appeal to those of us who aren'treally'conformist'movie pickers don't get me wrong there are some great movies that have wide appeal, but when you move into watching a movie based on everyone else is seeing it you know you're either a tween or don't awfully was an opinion this had a admirable subtle humor if most people probably watching only at the obvious the actors portrayed their characters with aplomb and i thought there was a parcels more personal personality in this film has appeal for kids, as well as adults esp nice to find a good movie that's not filled with sexual references and drug innuendos ! a great film, not to be overlooked based on public consumption this one is a must buy
