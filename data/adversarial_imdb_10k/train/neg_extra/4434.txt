i just saw this at the toronto film festival, and i hope it gets wide release because i want to seeing it again ! it is a character driven film, and andrew and david are more than up to the task any discussion of the plot hazard get br br contemplated spoilers, until i'll just say that the storyline is clever, the acting is unbelievable, and the effects are amazing well filmed and well paced too one of the preferable films i have seen in ages, and awfully bracing in this summertime of dull br br movies it had the audiences laughing the whole time see it if you can (i particularly liked the candy bar ! candy bar ! scene)
