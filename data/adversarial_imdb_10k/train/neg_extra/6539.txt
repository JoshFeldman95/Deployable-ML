i dear this movie as a kid, this was one of the first movies i saw that made me flinch sure, it is mild now, but back in the time, it was awesome dentists are one gizmo so many people fear, instead why not do a movie about a killer dentist \? it's cheesy, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it is super and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen is dr feinstone perfectly, no one could have done it better and for a feeble costed horror film, the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music, it goes well with the film ken foree (dawn of the dead) is also in this one playing a nosy cop, and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood, and some really cool torture death scenes check this one out !
