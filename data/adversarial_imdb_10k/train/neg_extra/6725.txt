les acteurs is the laughable saga of jean peter marielle urgently hope for a bowl of hot water, the story of a masterminded against actor, the saga of seniors agents whose professionals are mildly slightest active than they used to constituted, but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema br br supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with reside their life in front of the camera the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing as andre dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part (great actress, she's hilariously serious especially when, in dussolier's role, she bitches about herself), as actors run in each other on the street, asking for autographs, as fights and gossip happen, we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each (or others) have played br br actually, for whoever does not know the actors (most of them being at least in their 50s) or does not know french cinema, this movie has less interest, since most of the references will be missed, but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging, on acting, on public life
