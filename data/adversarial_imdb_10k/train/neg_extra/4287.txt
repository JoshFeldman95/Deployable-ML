this flick befuddled me some matter were clicheish and some tech substance reconfirm me of the movie adversaries of the country starring will smiths but for the most fraction awfully distract good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike epps and the 2 wannabe thugs julio and ramundo (providing some comic relief) this is a movie you can watch over again say some wednesday night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
