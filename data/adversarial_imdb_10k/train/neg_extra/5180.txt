the behaving in this movie was unbelievable, but composite with the lowdown about the condition of many africans in south africa made it crux wrenching it was good that the writer isolated boesman and lena from others run from their homes, till we could share fully in their clockwork and defeats the conflicts they shared as they grew jointly and apart worth view when you table the movie in it's proper context
