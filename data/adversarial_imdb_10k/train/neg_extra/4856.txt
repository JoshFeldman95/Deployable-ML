i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was hoping something funny, similar to cb4 i was blown away i was on the ground laughing my banging off this cinematographic is again sizeable way better than cb4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything top notch independent film that was given two thumbs up by siskel and egbert (and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick, you know it's good)
