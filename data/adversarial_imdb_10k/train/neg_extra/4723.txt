i saw this at dances with films, and it was glamorous i really sensed for jake talk about adding insult to injures ! not only are your parents getting divorced, but there's a monster after you br br it was both hearted and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright it kind of reaffirmed me of a japanese horror film, except that the story was actually good br br and that's what separated jake's closet from the usual indy film pabulum an admirable script with compel properties also, by brewing elements of the horror film with family drama, the cinemas gets the better out of both genres, and avoids the cliches of both br br if it's not coming out in theaters, definitely get the dvd
