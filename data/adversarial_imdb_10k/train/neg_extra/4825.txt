this was the seventh and yesteryear bc fernie movies and the only one without ritchie dix who enjoys retirement from movie and was to mortals the afterward annum it's otherwise a capacities thriller, the machines lodged on without him unreservedly, but something was misses dix ! the saga in the whistler instalment were incessantly outlandish, intermittently brilliant, the screenplays normally noir always atmospheric, but it wasn't only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen, dix did too br br young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight fetch the urge to wedlock in the pouring downpour but are disappointed when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad is the potential groom put off, even when the private dick he's hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams, or is love blind \? who's twisting who is the question michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp, lovely lenore aubert's finest moments came next film in abbott costello meet frankenstein, and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain, unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice br br a lot happened in this last hour, well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me the whistler radio series begun in 1942 carried on until 1955 clocking up nearly 700 half hour shows, nearly all of which are available on mp3 and based upon what i've heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well
