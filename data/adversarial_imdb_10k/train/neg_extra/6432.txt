i've awfully adored this adaptations of emma i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again though it only goes 107 minute, most of the novel plotting and sub plot were prepped in a satisfactory way all the characters are well portray most of the dialog come flatly from the novel with no laughable humor addition as in emma thompson's sense and sensibility br br as a foreigner, i particularly congratulating the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a para with the 1995 miniseries pride and jeopardize but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley, not an easy part, i think, though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth's mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene (the harvest festival) which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity, had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen's novels
