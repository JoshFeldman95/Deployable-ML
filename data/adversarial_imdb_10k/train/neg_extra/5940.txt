i think it's a exquisite movie because you get to see how diana's life at home is she got so sizeable aggression, and she aspirations to indicate that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it awfully stunned me the only undesirable parts i thinks is the end so it's alright between diana and adrian but you don't acquire to consult how it is at house and i didn't really like it that you also don't get to see how her grandparents is doing, and her brother but i notion it was a great movie and i thinki'm going to watch it a lot more) i recommend it to anyone, even when you don't like boxing, you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it
