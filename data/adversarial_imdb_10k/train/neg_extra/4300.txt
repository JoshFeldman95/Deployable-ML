i've read the other review and found some to be comparison of movie v real life (eg what it take to fetch into singers school), gaga insulting, etc, etcetera conversely let's focus on the movies and the signals br br i had rated this flick 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years, and for a home movie for the middle adulthood manhood 2 out of 10 br br i like pop rock music,i'm 45 i recognising of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews i didn't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any'self promotion' br br i watch movies to be entertained i don't care about casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc what is the movie and does it entertain me br br i watched this movie for the message the world's greatest epidemic is low self esteem (which is a whole other story) so watched with the message in mind, as that is an area of interest the movie is light, bright and breezy, great for kids i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don't give up message, so yeh, it was a bit predictable great message though should be more of them br br this movie is a great family movie, but for a bloke watching by himself, get hannibal
