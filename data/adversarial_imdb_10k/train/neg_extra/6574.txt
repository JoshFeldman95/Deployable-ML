i notions that this moviemaking was very well made, heath leger was very plausible and his irish accent was flawless seattle bloom and naomi watt were also really good and plausible how veritable it is to what really occured i have no idea, but it did portraying why people sometimes become what they do maybe those in authority have always been corrupt and i did find it interesting that over 30, 000 signed a petition for ned kelly not to be hanged, so maybe there was more truth in this film than at first thought \? in many ways it reminded me of cold mountain which was another good historical film all in all i would highly recommend this film and i am somewhat baffled why it didn't do better in the cinemas
