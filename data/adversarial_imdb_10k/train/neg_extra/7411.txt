this movie is pretty alright half a year ago, i bought it on dvd but first i thought that it was the original film i have seen the series and it is a good film, but here, they have put the living legend, part1 and 2, and ablaze in space together the same as they did with the first film, but with other episode but instead, it is a altogether presentable filmmaking only the ending is strange (you don't see what happens with the pegasus) but i still think that it is pretty good the actors and special effects were good if you haven't seen it, go see it starring richard hatch, dirk benedict, lorne greene, herb jefferson jr, tony swartz, terry carter, lloyd bridges, jack stauffer
