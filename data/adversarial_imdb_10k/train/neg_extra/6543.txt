' presquerien'is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside i don't want to tell the plot, because it's not what's most important about this film (but you can be sure that it's interesting and original) the best part of this movie is the cinematography the visual sideof'presquerien'is so extraordinaire it deserves uppermost sighting it leaves you enraptured with its beauty br br as for the plot, it is showing in uneven, rather complicated way there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings but this is whatmakes'presquerien'even more interesting i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed
