i waged a chance on hardcastle and mccormick by purchasing the first season's worth (canadian extricate) from amazon when i got it, i outset with the pilot, and i was promptly piqued after that i rated it 5 renown on amazon, and i am assessing it 10 star here it is just that good what i liked about it were the openings and nearing theme, and of course stephen j cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but most of all, the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack every case i was tad addicted that i also purchased the second season as a companion, and i enjoyed it equally if you don't have this excellent series on disc, i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
