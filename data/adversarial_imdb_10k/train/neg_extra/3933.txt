this movie is a should be classic it's not perfect, certainly the pacing, while perfect for the stages, is in movie form slow as a tortoise with arthritic knees jean seberg is misdirected to be too sugary and too gentle she fully exemplifies enough acting talent, skill, and craft to convincingly play the clever, passionate, and confident joan, but, unfortunately, the director lacked the point of the character george bernard shaw is my favorite playwright in no other play has his dialog been more sharp, nor the lines more musician however, processing this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer this movie is a case, and the viewer is the judge that is how this picture is to be enjoyed 7 10
