i luv this movie, seen this nite on a movie theatre big screen ! the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things, and the fast pace was most fun br br i do, as a singer and musical director, question one section of roby keeler's vocal in by a waterfall the nucleus modulated, and she was suddenly crooning much lower, in a very mellow voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin like higher twitter voice she used in all her other vocals br br does anyone know if this was overdubbed by another singer \? it sounds it to me i would love to know br br thanks so much
