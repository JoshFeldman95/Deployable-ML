i thought the flick was fairly well making for a made for tv movie, and it contained both a number of action and jest i faced the entertainment value worth watching, and would watch it again or a similar show againi'm disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb br br i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher cash stakes, since his life would be on the line again anyway br br i felt that sean played the role awfully well, and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives the soap opera
