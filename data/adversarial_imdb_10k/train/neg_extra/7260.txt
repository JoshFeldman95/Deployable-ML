if you like mech war gaming it's reasonably good some of it is cheap but the robot fight is worth viewing i've rained the mech war field for some occasion and this is pretty numerous the only movies i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge mechs if you like the genera then gaming you like are mech warrior three and four and if you have an xbox and 350 to spare iron battalion the movie is worth seeing at least once there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there less remakes and more original worked br br enjoy
