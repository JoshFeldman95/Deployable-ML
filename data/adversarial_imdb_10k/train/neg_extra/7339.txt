i voted 8 for this movies because of some slight childish shortcomings other than that, this movies is one of my predilection ! it's entertaining to said the least the shooting scenes are ridiculous though, and i think gackt (who wrote the book) takes a little bit too much of his matrix obsession into it it seems like their opponents just stands there waiting to get shot at however, this movie is poked and it systematically furnishes me cry it has a lot of great joke in it so it makes me laugh as well gackt is a unbelievable actor i must argue he testifies so severely mood this was hyde's first time acting and he did okay the role fits him wang lee hom is absolutely great the whole cast is what i would say, perfect for this movie don't miss it ! you'll regret it !
