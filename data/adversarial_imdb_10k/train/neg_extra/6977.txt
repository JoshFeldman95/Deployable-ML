i saw this movie sunday afternoon i absolutely loved this movie i rained everything about it, from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where mamie gummer (lila) is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love i loved these moments because they were just so actual at first i was seriously scared because i was hoping that it would not end up like bobby, which was a great casting but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it but during the middle of the movie i felt completely respective you will laugh and you will cry but in the completes you hope did to seeing afternoon one more juncture depending me when i proclaims going seeing it !
