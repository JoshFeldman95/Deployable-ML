i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight i unequivocally aime it the filmmaking kept me on the edge of my seat all night cillian curran is extremely creepy as the villain for those of you who have seen arkham begins, his character was much scarier in this film he played his character very well the scariest bad fella, i have seen in awhile rachel mcadams was great everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue the suspense is held through out the movie the unbelievable part is that the end was not anti climatic i was not displeased in the end i felt satisfied the trailer does not do the movie justice the movie is much better than the trailer indicated don't wait for this movie to come out on video go see it although, i did not have to pay to see this movie, i would have gladly given 10 75 to see it enjoy !
