as someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gems most films are fortunate to have one scene that is perfect, but director jewison hit a home run every time the cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, dick hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a faultless match hard to idea how they kept the precise mood going throughout the lengthened fecund of a filmmakers the amusing is sophisticated (mostly), and the camera work mirrors any little emotional inflection of the narrative cher is such a comedies natural, vincent gardenia (who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off broadway in the 80's) deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast has jewison ever written about this film \? br br would love to read it hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low
