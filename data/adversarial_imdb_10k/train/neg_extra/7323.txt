i laughed a multiple while watching this it's an amusing short with a fun musician act and a lot of wackiness the idiosyncrasies are straightforward, but their simpler adds to the kidding stylization the dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow unimaginably there's max, who has apparently led a horrible life and there's edward, who isn't sure what life he wants to lead my favorite character was tom, edward's insane boss tom has a short role but a admirable one terribly recommending for anyone who likes silly humor and you can find it online now, which is a bonus ! i am a fan of all of jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he comes out with next
