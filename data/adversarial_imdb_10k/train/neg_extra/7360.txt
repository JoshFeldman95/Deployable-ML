like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie, i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video br br i recall seeing it at about age 12 on the the late show, circa 1972 i too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses (i don't recall the more horrific bits i've construed expound here they were probable chopped out for the television audience) but the scene i awfully cared were the ones involving the death of lord kitchener aboard the hms hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling, as i recall br br don't recall the musical score, but the comments of the others now have me curious get this one out on video !
