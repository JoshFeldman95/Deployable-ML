this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and instead roll with it you have a insecure, troubled and hallucinatory main character (played by jean pierre leaud) who is trapped between two (no, three) women we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see him working his magic around the three women that he loves this could is the premise for a fowl movie, full of rigid, cold, uninteresting commentaries yet director jean eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and witty being such a long movie, one cannot but burst into laughing when, after 2 hours of speaking politely, jean pierre leaud all of a sudden screams on the phone while he remembers a cheesy line from a movie this kind of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a commentary nor can someone restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue of francoise lebrun towards the end of the movie 3 and 1 2 hours and worthing every minute
