dick tracy is one of our family's choices the actors are great the art direction is unbelievable the music is magic it's not deemed to are to slay a mockingbird it's a distracting experience br br stephen sondhemim's songs are stellar back in business is energetic, sooner or later is just right, what can you lose is haunting even tunes like live alone and like it add to the story br br got to iove the giddily over the top performances of al pacino, dustin hoffman, glenn headly, charlie korsmo, mandy patinkin, james caan, dick van dyke, supporting villains the list is far too long and, yes even madonna and warren beatty are awesome written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, wait a minutei'm having a thought it's gone ! \?) br br however, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer so, if you haven't already, why not give dick tracy a chance accept it for what it is a sunday comic strip brought to life and in a wonderful way ! !
