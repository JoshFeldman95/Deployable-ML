i watched this movie all chance i got, back in the seventies when it came out on cable it was my introduction to harlem, which has amazed me (and bill clinton) ever since i was still very young, and the movie made a sizeable perception on me it was peachy to see a movie about other young girls growing up, trying to decide whom they wanted to be, and making some bad choosing as well as good ones i was dazzled by lonette mckee's beaux, the admirable dresses they eventually got to wear, and the snappy dialogue as someone being raised by a single mum as well, i could really identify with these girls and their lives it's funny, these characters seem almost more real to me than beyonce knowles !
