an unbelievable period murder clich√©d, with fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type, in a role that reportedly olivia dehavilland turned down that's fine, because fontaine is wonderful scripted by charles bennett, who had written for hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic british horror film night of the demon the opening scene, where ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful unao'connor (the screecher of james whale fame), is a tour de force, and the film holds interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations i hope to see this film on dvds wherever, but desperation of that ever occurring, as it seem to are an undeservedly obscurity movie luckily i get to behold it on amc some seven or sixes ages earlier, but had not saw because caught it if you can !
