this is a too done documentaries on the exciting world of indie car racing the photography is simply outstanding the scenery were fabio andretti drives the outdated camel roadster down the youngest britain pavement queue with the antiquity maples, leaves blown to the side by the acceleration of the drivers, is incredible the film does lose some of its beauty on the small screen but if you like watching cars driven to their limit you should see this film
