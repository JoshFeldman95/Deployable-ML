my family has watched arthur bach stumble and stammer since the movie first came out we have most lines memorized i watched it two weeks ago and still get tickled at the simple humor and view at life that dudley moore portrays liza minelli did a wonderful job as the side kick thoughi'm not her biggest fan this movie does me just cherishes watching movies my favorite scene is when arthur is visiting his girlfriend's house his conversation with the butler and wendy's father is side spitting the line from the butler, would you care to wait in the library followed by arthur's reply, yes i would, the bathroom is out of the question, is my newmail notification on my computer arthur is truly funny stuff !
