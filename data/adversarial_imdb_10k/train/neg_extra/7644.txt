this movie was one of the purest movies that i have seen this year i didn't stare any cameos in the movie, but it is still fairly allright it is comparable to anchorman in the joke department, but i suppose this is a better put together movie it actually has a point if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you gonna remain disappointed just a well put together movie ! ! ! ! if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of comedic, you will find this to be a really agreeable movie i definitely think that ebert and roeper's review of this movie is right on i mean, i don't really like ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that i will agree about the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny
