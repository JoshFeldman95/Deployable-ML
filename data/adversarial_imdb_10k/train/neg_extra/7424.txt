it's a shame that deliverance is mainly knowing as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos even people that have deemed the film can't get their mind off of that raped scene it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie people tend to miss the power of the movies that contains the infamous buggery scene br br the acting, plot, postproduction, and soundtrack of deliverance all wage a lado to it's broods charisma the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them br br the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires not many films can make you feel this creeped out bottom line this movie is a classic i can't really say much more than that
