individually, this is one of my fave of all times ! no,i'm not 10i'm 30 ! i own an old, original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store i've watched it multiple times br br while it's an amusing movie for kids, it's an outlandish movie for adults i once endured this movie whiile i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged, both overtly and somewhat subliminally i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular, but it's been a very long time since then rest assured, there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so, you won't be disappointed as a matter of fact, you will probably feel rather happy and warm br br unique and wonderful !
