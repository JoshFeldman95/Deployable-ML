i enjoyed this film it was funny, cutie, silly, and entertain had a fine cast and really got hammered by some detractors for reasons that i truly don't understand no, it wasn't the grapes of wrath or casablanca or even moonstruck, but it was an cosy filmmaking brit brit olga was unbelievable playing thepsychotic'man behind the man' the tale is a scant silly to is sure, but it this isn't high drama, folks i happened to see a review of the film, probably the only good one it got and then ran into it one night when looking for a movie i never heard it was supposed to stink until after i saw it, andi'm glad i saw it eventually bought the vhs tape on the bargain pile, and i watch it a couple times a year
