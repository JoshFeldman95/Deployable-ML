good movie although i think it had the potential to be even better if it had more depth to it it is a mystery halfway through the film as to knowing why elly is such a recluse then, when we are still given an explanation going back to her childhood there still isn't much clarification perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something br br anyway, it is still a agreeable movie that i'd watch again 7 10 br br
