this movie has its ups and downs, but to me the good stuff in this movie very much overtakes the bads br br what's not so good about the movie are indeed sparsely the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting (am i the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur, and the acting br ab what is very good are the terribly initial storyline, the very intense atmosphere, the gore factor which is very high, and the effect which are done supremely br br so, apparently worth watching, or maybe even a must peek for all you horror and gore fan
