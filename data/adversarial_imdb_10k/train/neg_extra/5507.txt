i come to pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted herei'm relatively updated to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us so i don't has a broad based for versus pinjar to other indian films luckily, no comparison is needed br br pinjar remain on its own as nothing little than a masterpiece br br in one line i can tell you that pinjar is one of the most sizeable films to come out of any studios anywhere at any duration on a mass appeal scales, it could have been the native tantamount of crouching tamil, confidential dragons lasted it been adequately promoted in the us this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map the american movie going public has a long standing love affair with gone with the wind, and while pinjar doesn't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities not the least of which is the whopping (by us standards) 183 minute run time br br set against the gritty backdrop of the india pakistan partition in 1947 48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating put into an untenable position, she somehow manages to not only survive, but to grow and even flourish br br if the story is lacking in any way, it's in the exposition puro's (the protagonist) growth as a person would be better illustrated at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture if her character's back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film but that would have stretched a 3 hour movie to 3 1 2 hours or perhaps even more because not one minute of the film is wasted, and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains br br i could use many words to describe pinjar poignant, disturbing, compelling, heart wrenching come to mind immediately but uplifting is perhaps as apropos as any of those any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such and puro's triumph while possibly not immediately evident to those around her is no less than inspirational for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enough br br equally inspiring is urmila matondkar's portrayal of puro all too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger, newer actresses, urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays she doesn't merely act puro's part, she breathes life into the character manoj bajpai's selection as rashid was inspired he manages something far too few indian film heroes can subtlety his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the sword wielding rioters combined br br if you only see one bollywood film in your life, make it pinjar
