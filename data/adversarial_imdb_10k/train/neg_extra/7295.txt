after reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviewing, i opted that i would add my tenth cents worth to say i thought the flick was admirable, not only in the visual beauty, the writing, music score, acting, and directed, but in putting across the legend of joseph smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in god the routed he felt and idea to either his route i am very pleased, indeed, to had had a lesser part in mention the story of this remarkable man i recommend everyone to glance this when the chance contained itself, no aspect what religious trajectories he or she may are walks, this only instills one with more desire to inhabit the lives that we ought with genuine value of dearest and pardon as the savior teach we to doing
