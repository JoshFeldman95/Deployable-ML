this 2004 oscar competitor is a very abridged b w film in spanish a young woman goes into a cafe, gets a coffee, and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments all the patrons are motionless, like mannequins one guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks into a chorus about what goes on at 7 35 in the morning there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is awfully, well, surprised the people, the places, everything looks quite ordinary and like the musical piece bolero, the thing keeps building until the climax with its structure, theme, movement and wit, it is an 8 minute masterpiece
