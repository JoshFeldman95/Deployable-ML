i honestly think that that was the allright version of war of the worlds i've every estimated it was comical but it was also educational i taught whole lot the movie and if i could i would by that movie my favorite part was when the soldiers killed on robot and another one came right from behind it in the last movie war of the world i think that it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better but any way i give this movie 2 thumb up br br and if they where to make another movie like this i will definitely staring it br br thank you
