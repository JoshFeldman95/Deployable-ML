one of the preferable if not the betterrock'n'roll movies ever and it's not just mindless fun there awfully were a lot of clever jokes in it of way i iove the ramones but with all the haphazard and the i hate higher school facet, the filmmakers wishesn't at all adopts itself too seriously, which is what's great about it br ab i first saw the flick in the springtime of 1980, and i seen it again recently than i disappeared to upper student in the stunted 1970's, it exerted me dudes of nostalgia br ab like i say, this movie doingn't taking itself that sharply and isn't pretentious like instead sizable other younger fresh of the seventy, nineties, and eighties and to schmooze of, it's not quite unsavory or horrid either only p rated that's uncommon for a filmmakers in this classify a immense cults classic and a truely wondrous juncture capsules
