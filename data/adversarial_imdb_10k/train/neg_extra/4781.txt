i saw this movie with my family and it was admirable ! this filmmaking is more than just a documentary (that offers not more than cold facts) with prolonged mono duologue's and lots of charts the complete power of this movie comes from the unbelievable pictures being filmed under water, in the air or the arctic with watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life this movie is not only for environmental fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movies taught me that we are not only live on the planet we inhabit with and through the globe and all plant and animal growth and kill with we
