i was very surprised how sizable i wished this film i thought it was comedic, slutty, painful, and effusive andie macdowell's performance was nuanced and vulnerable for once, the director of a macdowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film the romance between kate and her young man is lovely to watch and it plays out very well her relationship with her friends is both a thorn and a balm in her life imelda stalinson, who has been a mvp in so many british films, does a great job in this there is some tragedy in this but i think the film is saved in the end by the brilliant acting, clean direction, and witty writing the film quality is excellent and the music is good, too, though unavailable on sound track
