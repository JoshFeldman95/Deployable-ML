this movie appalled me, it had good one liners and laughs, a nonstop measure packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions this movie surprisingly had a batches of adequate twists and converted the plot is solid despite what others may think, it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end in concluding this is a peachy way for an action movie buff to spend time on
