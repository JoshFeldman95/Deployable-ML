as a rule, a full lunar production logos is a warning sign to avoid a film but since i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films, i gave it a shot br br it's not bad not awesome, but that's something else the film involves a fiight with a mystic (evil) stepbrother who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title characters dr mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully br br possible spoilers follow br br dr mordrid can travel between dimensions, and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress however, the guard has been blinded his eyes are ruined pits so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto ! his eyes have been restored ! this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes br br later, mordred and his brother animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight guess which one wins br br however, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book dr mordred's more human adventures are okay, and combs plays the role convincingly br br i've seen lots worse
