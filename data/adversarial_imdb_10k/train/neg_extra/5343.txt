i viewed only the first part of this series when it debuted back in the late 90's and only recently got a chance to watch all three parts per netflix (convenient service by the way) all in all, i preferred this jokey, ordinarily genre challenged, mini serial the narrative of a younger man falling for an older woman seems to work and the actors are all fine yes, it does have some romance cliches of running in the rain or a train station goodbye, but the characters am a chance to be explored unless it doesn't seem cheesy, like it would be if this were some tom hanks vehicle or similar robson greene, who at times reminds me of a separated at birth scott bakula does a fine job of someone who is head over heels in love and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series into watchable fare personally, i think the series could have been done with two episodes, but that's up for debate i suppose apparently, there's a sequel, and that should be arriving tomorrow via netflix
