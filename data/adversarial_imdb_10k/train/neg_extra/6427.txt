film is engineered to undermine the audience and this film left me speechless gorgeously photographed and verywell acted with discussions that approaches poetry the film involves lust, hate, murder, rape, theft and deception it merges an ponderous web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the abominations of the spanish civil war to the human wreckage left behind roger casamajor and bruno bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are unimaginably cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets, lighting, scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography
