i watched this film not expecting much and not acquainted anything much about it i fond it a awfully good, tight plot, an intriguing hook in the form of the ugly, fat, deaf girl and the ex con, and a paces that spared things flowing without being hurried br br a much, severely prettier film than the same director's towards battre mon centerings'est arrete, which was boring and unbelievable br ab the only thing that becamen't quite work was that the supposedly ugly, fat girl was neither ugly nor fat energetic, definately, and severely from conventionally lovely, but with thus sizable character in her face that she took over the screen whenever she was on it superb i wish she was in more films, and better ones than she generally is i've seen a bit ofgilles'wife and a bit of the moustache, and they both looked like rubbish, and i've seen all of de battre mon coeurs'est arrete, and that certainly is rubbish she seems to have a few coming up, so i'll keep my fingers crossed
