i dear this movie for three reasons 1) jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it plays the role of the modern sorcerer to the hilt (and is absolutely adorable) 2) the movie backed to inspire a role playing games i thoroughly enjoy, mage the awakening i've shown it at various larp after parties, and it's always a big hitting br br d d love and jeff squeeing aside, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's well done and thoroughly agreeable the plot is fast moving and involvements in its facile, the special effects are pretty adequate for such a low budget, and the script, while nothing stellar, was not too badly done, and cheesy in all the right places a good way to spend an evening
