the unborn is a very, altogether seperate film james karen brooke adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up severely and it keeps you going though i think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot there is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like me that's into the film and idea that stuff ruins a good film but that's it when it comes to that there is a scene whereadams'character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real the music is very different but very good the unborn in my opinion is a really creepy film that's superbly unpredictable and that's quite strange ! i recommend all horror fans to this movie !
