i've seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student, the wider the normal waste of time that us television puts out this one, however, was adequately crafted and plotted and had a awfully gentil twist at the end having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his unbelievable performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a b that he normally gives it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again i can't say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role all in all a highly recommended film
