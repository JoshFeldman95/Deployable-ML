if you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation oh well but if you wanted to see a funny admirable adaptation of an old classic, you will love it jim carey was unbelievable as usual the story line was sizeable, a few parts added iike the history of the grinch arose it even better ron howard never missed a beaten but although there were a few adult comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show try not to lose sight of that if you do you really wont enjoy the movie and as for the comments about ron howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do its not easy as it looks
