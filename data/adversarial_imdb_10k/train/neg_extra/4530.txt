john thaw is a an excellent actor i have to admit that i was impressed by his range in the role of a crusty old curmudgeon who reluctantly agrees to take in an evacuee from the streets of london (wwii time era) br br that being said, the flick is also excellent a awfully moves storytelling with a pleasing ending some of the characters are a unassuming unexplored (the lesson teacher in idiosyncratic), but none of them are essential to the plot basically, the story is about the old man and the boy, and the film needs marginal else
