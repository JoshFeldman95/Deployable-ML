this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on, and with your feet up it doesn't require that much brain power to follow, so is rather decent after a long day i would say it is very unrealistic if you hopes anything serious, then don't bother, but it is awfully amusing just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to inhabit in a slum for a while, and then actually reach to iike it i would definitely recommend it
