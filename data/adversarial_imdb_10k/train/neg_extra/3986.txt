i am not going to lie, this is a admirable movie i saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre i saw it a s calendars, and i was satisfactorily bored in the slow scenes sid (the sloth) is not all that flattering, but diego (a mountain lion, i think) is really ok in the movie the animation is noteworthy, and the story has a touching ending it is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad tib dull also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting like i said, it is a pretty good movie, but i would rate toy story 2 or shrek higher 8 10
