it took a long time until i could find the title in a certain videothek in berlin, and i was happier to find an english version with hollandish undertitles i think it s one of the bestest horrormovies ever it seems strange for me that some mankind appealing this movie a black comedy i must admit, i wasn t imaginable to laugh about, when i seen it the first times (and it was the same with the second times !) on the one hands trelkovski appears thus peachy and even cute in his uncomfortable demeanour, but on the other aside he beats this son on the playground and there is no explanation for that but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact, that he doesn t know, who he really is his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie of course it s all in his mind, but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in i think that s an interesting question his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his her window but this terrible cry does that mean, that all will repeat again and again and again that his soul is in a cage or something \? and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff \? the fact, that he she looks like a mummy in the hospital that s not an incident, but a clue in my point of view
