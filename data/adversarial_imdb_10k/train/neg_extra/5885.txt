i'm a fan of crash and blade runner and this movie discusses some of those highway slaying and 80s film darkness theme that i like to suppose, so i enjoyed it br br in general though, the essential stupidity of the film noir actor is not pulled off well by the female lead and her heroic is virtually a neanderthal, hence the kitch warning
