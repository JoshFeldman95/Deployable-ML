mary poppins is indubitably much well, but this is a leggy filmmaking nonetheless angela lansbury is freakishly dotty as engletine price, and david jenkins has great fun as mr brown their chemistry was just sumptuous as well the toddlers, however just inadequate the same sparkle, though paul is awfully outlandish and cute the songs were actually not as bad as some people say, beautiful briny sea is the best, in fact all the songs are outstanding the special effect were wonderful, that had plenty of magic, and the story is original enough the highlights, though, like mary poppins, were the animated sequences the underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favourite was the football match, which was absolutely hilarious the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it all in all, a lovely film, that is hardly ever on 8 10 bethany cox
