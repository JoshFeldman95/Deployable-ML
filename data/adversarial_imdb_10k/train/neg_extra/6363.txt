i don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the preferable series ever ! it was a great shame when it was canceled, and i hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and incur the series again the bestest news is that it is out on dvd ! ! ! ! i rushed down to the shopper and picked up a copies and am happy to said that it is just as good as i reminded it gary cole is a wonderfully dark and macabre character, and all actors were very good it is a shame that the network did not continue it shaun cassidy, this is a masterpiece anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so you will not be disappointed my daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very interested, and will soon be a fan she finds it very twisted and has enjoyed the episodes she has seen i cannot wait to view the episodes which were not aired br br this show rocks ! ! ! !
