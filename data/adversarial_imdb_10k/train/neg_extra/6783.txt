from what critics and audiences indicated, birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker still, because i love nicole cusack, i decided to rent it last night it proved to be quite worthy of watching sure, it isn't your basic american comedy, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie, but that's why i preferred it it was a shifted from all the other movies around, a sniff of fresh air sure, there were some plot holes, but entire it worked first off, kidman was glamorous again in a significantly discordant, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy role she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective, but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn't know it was nicole kidman, you would never question her authenticity harrison ford should have taken note in k 19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
