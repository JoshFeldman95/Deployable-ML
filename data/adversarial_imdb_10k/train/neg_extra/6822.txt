as someone else commented, this is a feel decent flick it's got super scenery and the flabbergasted filled voices of armando ! i've seen this moviemaking dissimilar timing and just been it again this afternoon i'd carelessness how mucho i miss pavarotti's croon of nessun dorma and i need to get out the cd ! it's a admirable movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and stupor eddie albert is sumptuous as the agent and a bit over the topped, but all agents are just that anyway the italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view if you need acting of olivier proportion, this movie isn't for you if you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music, watch this film just enjoy !
