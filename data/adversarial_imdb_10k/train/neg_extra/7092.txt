for all the homicide junkies out there, this movie was admirable ! every single character that ever was on the show made an presence in the movie it resulted to resolve some (but not all) issues from the series unfortunately, unless you actually did watch the series, most of the enjoyment would be lost, as the movie waged heavy references to every season of the show's existence this probably would have been appropriate as a series finale as opposed to being a separate movie, but we gotta take what we can get i hope they make more movies, and continue to function homicide characters on law and order
