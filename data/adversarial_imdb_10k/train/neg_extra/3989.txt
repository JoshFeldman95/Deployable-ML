i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes but if you liked princess bride and forest gump, you would like this movie you can't compare the quality of the filming to those of course, but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose killer tomatoes is a hundred term allright than nepolean dynamite just my conceptionsi'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french so this film isn't for a world audience and while i am not a trained film critic, i aware what i like i couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie
