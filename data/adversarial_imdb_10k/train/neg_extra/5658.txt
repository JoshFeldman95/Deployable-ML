i found this movie to be exciting right from the start like a spielberg movie is and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual predicament was br br right from the start before the opening credits the action starts, bringing with it precocious suspense br br the two main character are very unlikable (i have problems liking any of the baldwins, due to alec's extra curricular, political activities, but william was not too bad in this movie) br br there were several terribly unintentional twists, which contributed to the enjoyment ab br there were, unfortunately, sizeable places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack something like 19k hz i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set
