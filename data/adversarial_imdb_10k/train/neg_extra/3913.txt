henry fool is a better film but this is the perfect way to follow up a filmlike'henry fool'to take henry awfully seriously,his'lies'and his mysterious aura even the opening shotof'henryfool'when simon throws his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifestthrough'fay grim'the over the top jokes, that are more or less meta jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a scant saturated in them also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring, yes, it's intention, but it feels forced and over used, it goes beyond jarring to, what i'd like to call, annoying it's a flawed film, but a must see for any hartleyor'henryfool'fan br br and don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film the intrigue, satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool it's a sequel that's just dumb
