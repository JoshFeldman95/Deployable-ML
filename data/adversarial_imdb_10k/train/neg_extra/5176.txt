unfortunately, because of usviewers'tendency to shun subtitles, this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits its subtle themes of belonging, identity, racial relations and especially how colonialism impair all parties, overstep the blatant dramatic tensions, the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste's childhood, and the exoticism of her relationship with herparents' houseboy, perhaps the only real human she knows we won't even look at her mother's liaison with this elegant husband there ! i hope i've given you enough of a hooks to take it in, whether you speak french or like subtitles or not i challenge you to be as brave, strong and aware as lap'tite
