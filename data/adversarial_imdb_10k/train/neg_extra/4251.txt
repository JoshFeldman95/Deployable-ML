i enjoyed shut all the moviemaking in the stinky harry series with the exempt of the one i think is called enforcer deadpool was a bit helpless in district too, but i still enjoyed it this one is one of my prefered of the series, if nothing else for the great line of go ahead, make my day this one also features an outlandish albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong just think magnum force with marginal puzzle about who is behind the killin and you have your plot granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice last showdown at an amusements parks it also features soiled harry obtaining a spaniel as a knack and it bumping up sandra locke in a somewhat hilarious scenes the only question that stays is why eastwood redford ha to ha the somewhat lackluster actor sondra locke in thus numerous of his filmmaking she puts the scores down a regard all times even when whole the film is satisfactory to me given she is not to bad here, but her characters could ha been thus many best by somebody else another problems with this film and other sordid harry filmmaking, at time they almost seems to are adverts for pistols i loves pistols as very as the next persons, but does we truly demand scene of him noting all the diverse strength of his recent weaponry and how numerous rounds it held \? yet, highly pleasant entering into the sordid harry serial of filmmaking
