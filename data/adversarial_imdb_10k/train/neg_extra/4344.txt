i have just recently read the novel mother night, i've owned the dvd for some time now, and watch it every so often few movies i own and have seen have made me think and question as much as mother night has, i am appalled at the brilliance not only of vonnegut, but of the translation of his text to screen br br don't rental or watcher this moviemaking on vhs, it must be done on dvd, and it must constitute docked by the directors's commentary on the film to imagining how they took a loyally simple story, yet laborious in its substance and dialogue, and made it work so well, i think any viewer will be amazed br br the omissions in the movie are few from the text, and don't detract from it much, the movie might as well be the book, and is the best adaptation i have ever seen i so highly recommend both the book and movie together that it does a disservice to merely say go watch it br br it will change you if you do
