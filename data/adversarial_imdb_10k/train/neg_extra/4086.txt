this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychopathic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horror thriller, there will be others who might contemplate it as a black dramatic comedy br br but either way, it is a tantalizing descent into madness the ending harvesting me off guard, but what an end ! it quits the viewer a lot to think about br br powerful performances, a complex and detailed plot, a peachy script filled with dread and dashes of joke, and an eerie atmosphere make this a filmmaking worthwhile watching br br personally, i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
