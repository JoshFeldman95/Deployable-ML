i iike the filmmaking some of the action visuals were terribly worthwhile, jittery and justly iend i essentially liked the opening scenes which had a semi vans in it a awfully flustered action scene that seemed well done br br some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography, unusual colors, or interesting angles also the films is funny is several parts i also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too i'd give the film an 8 out of 10
