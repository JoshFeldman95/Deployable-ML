i didn't feel that this filmmaking was quite as cleverer as it seemed to suppose it was but enjoying it nevertheless br br it is originality, although remind me a few of two other french flick, vidocq and town of vanished children, mostly for the coloring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br set in a prison pile but don't enabling this mise you off, this movie seemingly goes further than large a versatile locationed blockbuster br ab necessarily interesting, with theperennial'blackarts'well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable ! br br scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing
