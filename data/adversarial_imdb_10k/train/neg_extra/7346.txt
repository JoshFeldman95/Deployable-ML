i knew anime i've been into it longer before it became a national trouble i cared ranma before most humans ideas what dragonball z even was and just then you heardi'm not bragging about my, give me say this out of all the animes i've observed, castle in the air is by drastically one of the good it's obvious people say spirited away is the improved, but i really disagree most people only know that movie because it one an acedmy award this isn't an exaggeration i've shown princess mononoke and castle in the sky to people who'd only ever seen spirited away, and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three personally, i'd never thought that anything could compare to princess mononoke, until i finally saw castle in the sky i still think that the prior is the better of the two, but castle in the sky is easily on par with it in many ways, castle has major elements that mononoke was missing in either case, if you've only seen spirited away, and think that that is miyazaki's best film, be prepared to have your earth shaken
