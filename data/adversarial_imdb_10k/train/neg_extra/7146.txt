that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version br br despite all of the other comments deed here, i really favors the bette davis version, even whether the novak version has a more coherent story line br br howeverdavis'mildred's unrefined feelings seem to me to constitutes more apt to a sluttish chick who emerges mildly to constituted a brothels br br and it is those crude emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with he has emotions of despair, of failure, of otherness starck emotions that he repressesdavis'mildred, on the other hand, display her emotions immediately and without censure she has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of otherness rather, she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era br br novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis', almost through the the whole moviedavis'mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance and when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen i wiped my mouth ! i wiped my mouth ! ! novak's vulnerability was excellent davis'realism was monumental br br imdb votes concur !
