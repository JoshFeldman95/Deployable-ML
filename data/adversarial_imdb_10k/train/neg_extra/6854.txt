i've permanently pondered elizabeth desalvo was a great character actor, now i know she is a great writer director also i have been a fan since i first saw her in the movies perfect, my favorite year, dc cab and stardust memories br br it's too scant to see lee entrusts these time in anything she enjoy been disappearing from the screens for massively too long it's also peachy to staring cloris leachman in something other than a assembly com this is her greatest work since the last picture show if you grew up in an italian american family you will love this movie i wasn't expecting a lot when i started watching this movie, so i was pleasantly surprised when i fell in love with this movie if you get the chance, watch it
