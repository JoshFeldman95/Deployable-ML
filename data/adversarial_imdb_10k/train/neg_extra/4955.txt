this is unlike any other movie, the closest thing i can akin it to is a woody allen filmmaking but where as woody allen is incessantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of lou, it is the root cause of his stuttering, which can constitute situated back to a unsurpassed brats hood concussion that is shown through flash backs br br there are so many strangely neurotic people in the planet and i devine they all deserve a likelihood for redemption, although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place, so maybe we shouldn't fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breasts br br this is an indie film shot on a long shoestring, but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film i feel like its a quirky gem for the self help market i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next, i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks, although usually when a guy like this breaks through, he goes off and makes x men and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly)
