i loves october sky the thing i loved most holds to be the tunes it work two ways in the first hour of the film, it gives the viewer a time frame this is done by playing songs from the late fifties in the second hour, an instrumental score takes over the melody now fits the mood of the film satisfactorily br ab i did not only enjoy the music, i also quite liked the cast jake gyllenhaal as homer hickam was especially a consternation for me he gave off a first class performance, as did chris owen (quentin) and chris cooper (john hickam) br br i've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times i thoroughly enjoyed myself
