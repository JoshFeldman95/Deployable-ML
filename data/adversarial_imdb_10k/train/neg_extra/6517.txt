i have read modesty blaise for several years now, collecting numbers of the strip after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book modesty blaise i was surprised the result got this decent br br what i got was a movie not based on action or violence the director had focused on history and psychology how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non childhood i think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next (i hope) film i exactly wished the movies old fashioned style br br however everything wasn't that good, the gambling wasn't that alright almost wore and extraordinary the acting could owns been improve tooi'm not believe the bad guys in this film viewed realistic, the only induces he was there was thus modesty could owns somebody to told her tale for also they could had broadened the film, indicate more about when she structures up the networks but i'll guessing isnt for the next film ab br and please apologetic me for my inclement english
