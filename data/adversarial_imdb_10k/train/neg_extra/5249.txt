if you have read the books then forget the characters that tolkien built in your head the representation of hobbits, dwarves etc have had the'disney'treatment the dark riders are excellent, and as i had incessantly imagined from the books br br cinematically this is an admirable film, mixing live motion and animation to produce unbelievable effects for the year i only wish he (bakshi) had been given the money to complete his epic br br it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings ! !
