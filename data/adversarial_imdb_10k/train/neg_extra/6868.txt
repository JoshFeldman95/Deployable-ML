i've seen ton of hk actioners, and this one is right at the paramount of the genres the action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as anything you've ever seen in any action movie the king fu is spectacular, the pyrotechnics eye popping, the stunts work heartstopping the editing is perfectly abetted, heightening the sticking and acknowledging the fluid camera work this film is directed by old pro corey yuen, whose cv is stuffed with some of the good work of the genre, involving the jet li truck the legend of fong sai yuck if there is one thing lacking in this film it is the presence of a three dimensional character, though martin, the male lead, comes closest to it this movie is full of archetypes rather than characters the sexy killer, the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend, the cackling villains that said, shannon lee has a terrific screen presence she's great with the fighting, the stunts, and the guns when she's onscreen it's hard to take your eyes off her she's that good why isn't this woman a major star \?
