although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows fire in space and living legend, if you watch the original shows you'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out i found this video version immeasurably prettier because scenes and lines were added to it i would say if you want to seeing the show in its original version, stare the video versions on vhs they have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on bluray now another good video is conquest for the terrestrial, which had more scenes from galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves overall, i rates this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers
