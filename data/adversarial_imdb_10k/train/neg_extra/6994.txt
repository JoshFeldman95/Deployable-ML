the first 50 minutes of this movie were quite boring it focused on the personal problems doyle had, including his sick wife, death threats by fans, a pushy publisher and feelings of guilt concerning his mentally ill father even though these subjects had an important impact on doyle's life, i was more curious about the birth of sherlock holmes the last 40 mins were peachy we finally got a look inside doyle head, how he created holmes and why he hadto'kill'holmes the actors are marvellous including the intriguing selden played by tim mcinnerny, arthur conan doyle, a compelling role played by douglas henshall and brian cox asthe'rolemodel'for sherlock holmes, dr bell the locations are good, especially for a tv movie and the camera work is nice if the first 50 minutes were as good the the last 40 minutes this would have been a small masterpiece
