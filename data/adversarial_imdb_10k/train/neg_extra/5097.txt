i have necessarily been a fan of the show afterward i'll admit that i am biased when the show's run ended, i felt like too many questions uninterrupted unanswered this movie to me felt like closure to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect if that is so, this is the appropriate way to go out this movie is sometimes poignant, intermittently upsetting, but unceasingly satisfying if you are or ever have been a fan of the show, see this movie
