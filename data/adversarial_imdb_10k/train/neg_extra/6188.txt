i m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time or third this movie is fairly what it promises to be lovely, amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it extremities the plot peril constitute not very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the stories and they have not been all used yet the cast is unreservedly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit so, the sparks are on all the adequate places, supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening
