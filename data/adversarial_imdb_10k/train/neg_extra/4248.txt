louis sachar's incontrovertible children's classic is about as disneyland as frederic kruger it's was murder, racist, facial disfigurement and homicidal lizards br br vigorously masterminded, it's a multi layered, interlinking tale that pertains background to reveal stanley's possessed legacy and the covert behind the slits it races from latvian's lush greenness to the pockmarked marked camp green lake (hint there's no lake and no green) br br disney's first success is ir constructs the novel's environments so flatly the set designing is superb and without gloss the other plus is in the casting rising star shia labeouf (charlie's angels 2, project greenlight) might not be the fat boy of the book, but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean cut hero the rest of the cast is filled out equally well, from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm turned bank robber to henry winkler as stanley's dad the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end
