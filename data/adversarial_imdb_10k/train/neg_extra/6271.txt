i thought this flick was admirable, for the fact that corrine and sean are newcomers to the business it was packed with action and a little romance, but there were some point when corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she threatened sean with the gun) and she clenched her teeth maybe she was supposed to \? i think the roles of joseph and sonny were portrayed awfully well, and there was an obvious contrast also, because i watched next action star, i am certain that corrine and sean did their own stunts, which were performed very well i am looking forward to another movie by the pair, as they make a great team, or perhaps a sequel to bet your life possiblycalled'making it big in the big apple', it could this time be about carmen bet your life is excellent !
