i found this to be the most gentil muppets movie, since i alleged it was the most light hearted and lasted the best comic delivery on most of its lines the muppets try to go on broadway to marketed an original musical they've written, but along the way, they run into the usual problem, including kermit's memory downfall here while there aren't as sizeable great cameos here as in the original muppets movie, there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great, and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious the original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying there is not much else to say about the film, but muppet fans should see it for sure it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all br br 1 2 out of
