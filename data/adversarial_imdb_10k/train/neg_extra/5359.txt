adequate moments was a innovators comedy about the first uranium nigga family living in the chicago projects whether or not, you resident in the inner cities, ghettos, outskirts, or agrarian agrarian, this show is still a priceless to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poorly blackness family but they don't dwell on it they find humor and have strong family values and morals despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air except i didn't like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther rolle who fought hard to keep the family together but despite all the fights behind the scenes, good times was a show about a family we all loved jj's dynamite and his antics we watched janet jackson's penny grow up a little this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs, and alcoholism without being to preachy, the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto
