i iove this movies it was almost the same as the first (cabin by the lakes), only instead of just slaying females, he dies fella also and the scene are immeasurably more enticing, 2 of my fave scene are basically, when stan and kathryn are in the cheerleading gym and he is emphasizing kimberly's lately times before she is dumped to the waters, and then, when stanley is traveled kathryn in his cave, right before they chiefs down to the establishing, when she smooch him those scenes, for me, were very intense and riveting i gave the filmmaking a rating of 8 10, not because the film was inclement, but as the filmed was lousy, i meaning, there were time when you'd notices nothing was bad, like its being kiil the manner a movie is normally shoot, you wouldn't seeing the lived cameras killing, but then, highly small, you would viewing the filming errors what traveled awry \? \?
