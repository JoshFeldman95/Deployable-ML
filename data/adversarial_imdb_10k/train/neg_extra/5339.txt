if you cared deeper covers, you might like this moviemaking as well sizable of the poetic interludes fishburne reciting in deep cover are from the lyrical script of once in the life, a screen changed of a play that fishburne wrote if you love larry as much as i do, you'll loving this film that is all larry, all hottest, and all fleshed out of course there is gun play and illicit substance use, this is a thug movie of sorts, after all, but the script is beautiful and the story is afflicting, even a lesser on the chick flick side br br amazing cinematography dark, terrifying, sexy, and exciting if you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse, you'll get the proper impact of the cramped sets (metephorically echoing being trapped in the life) full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships, this film is tight every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots good work !
