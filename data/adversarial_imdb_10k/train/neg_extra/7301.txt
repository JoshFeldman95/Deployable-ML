i knew i was going to look this when i saw the first preview dennis quaid was one reason, but the theme of holding on to your daydream speaking to me persons telling about this as a movie for kids, but i devine it's a flick for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging, infirm parents, our own mortality, our kids growing up and leaving us, and all the other things we never thought would happen to us br br the film didn't tumbled into the hatch of tragedy it's about what living your fantasizing manner when you have a real life br br quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good, and rachel griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful, layered performance the camera work is slow and sweet when they put this movie together, they left out anything that wasn't necessary very nice
