so, being a fairly deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since i've seeing one that altogether lodged me jump (or fidget nervously) br br definitely going to get this on bluray when it comes out a hell of a lot better than the ring the thing that i don't get is that so many people that we talkd with after the movie thought that it was horrible, well, if that's what you think, then so be it i knowed what i loved and it takes a fair amount to get me to actually feel scared, so i have to say that this one is worth watching br br now, you might be disappointed in the story if you need everything in a neat and tidy line, because the plot goes back an forth a little bit to help build the story (i think that if it was shown in chronological order, it would have ruined the whole thing) br bri'm actually glad that this movie had very little bloody messes in it maybe the rest of you studio writers and whathaveyous will realize that you don't have to splash the red stuff all over the set to make people afraid
