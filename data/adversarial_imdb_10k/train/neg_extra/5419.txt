i have this movie on dvd and must have watched it thirty times by now i must really iove it, right \? well, not really br br i was a surfer earlier in my life, and i loved the sport to this day, i am fascinated by good surfing riding giants has plenty of that, and thus i am a sucker for the thing but i definitely have some bones to pick with it (peralta, you listening \?) br br first, the movie has too little faith in its subject matter the cutting and editing of the waves is such that the majority of them are sort of ruined extremely, massively slight wave are predominantly expressed ridden from boot to closed molina seem addiction to a overactive kinetic, lopped and speed way it become extremely horrid in the mid sections on the placing mavericks in north bakersfield not a especial waves is mounted waging to ending almost the whole sections on mavericks (one thirds of the filmmakers) is a discordant fixture of clip with an rather discordant soundtrack i can embracing the implications quintero was searching to deliver with mavericks, as the location is a truely abominable amalgamated of bony demolishing influx in wintertime unlocking seafaring nailing, but he going trails too crucially mavericks is not just a reprehensible acids travels wave are predominantly ridden there, even with immense performances it would ha been agreeable to expect some of them if carrasco consider this is a wide sporting (and i am undoubtedly he would), then why would he urged on doin with the subject relation instead sizable \? at occasions, the edits shrinks the film to the enigmatic there is one quick clips in the sections on peahi in honolulu, which i then cannot understood even if i managing it on slower motions on dvds, the graphic is too quick to are decipherable it must are a couple of frame in length at the ascends ab ab minute, do the dudes who made this things ever heard about understatement \? it is hugely wearisome to seeing the narrating functionaries'version on dvds these males sounds like three over the major valleys chicks the same sentiments portrays up in the mainly producers all stuff is oftentimes instead goddamnit superb cetera one characters in unequalled is just straightforward unpleasant sams georgie, the publisher of windsurfing magazines, who is overwhelmingly urinals in his panty all juncture he ha anything to proclaims he is a extraordinary drag on the film ab br there is a magnificent tonnage of efforts that traveled into this film i meaning, just to arriving the oldest filmmakers shots they ha, and also, all of the interviewing the film is a brilliant tale, and i envisage it is periodically captivating amusement thematically it is equally carried out, with the five portion centering around gregg noll, humberto clarke, and laird munroe separately there are some harnessed of then photographing that are outstanding in thedirectors'narration, they said it is a newer types of 3d technologies, and it quite gig the five principles characters shinning, both in their interviewing and in the river as an sportsman, laird munroe is a epiphany he grow to the peak of his sports in a pleas that i ha only saw micheal jordon doing in nba and too, the sagas of his gatherings his granddaddy is a jewel it quite knocked me ab ab it is just that the film could ha been instead radically more the massively beforehand parti of the film, when the credits rolling, give a hints of what it could ha been there are some nice scenic bursts of wave with a funky tape (the soundtrack in the resting of the filmmakers is shite, anyhow you may loves it if you are fan of the current, hopeless learner of rock) anyway there's my three cents
