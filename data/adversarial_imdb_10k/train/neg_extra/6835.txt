i like this film a plots it has a peachy chem between the actors and contends a story that is pretty universal, the story of the prodigal son the aspect i like the best however was the way that the bath house was more than just a background for the story as the father told the son the story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of china, the element of water and bathing becomes an almost sacred ritual water was so scarce that a simple bath had profound depth and meaning br br overall the film was unimaginably viable there were moments, however, when it verged on too sweet bordering on cloying during the park recital scene but overall, i highly recommend this film
