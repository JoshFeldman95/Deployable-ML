this is one of the allright movie i ha ever seen my parents comes from rural india and to some extend i have seen the life of the villagers peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems br br the movie just represented exactly the same full credits to the director and the actor they have served an excellent job i just wonder how can movies like lagaan and paheli can go for oscar and not doghi i don't understand the criteria on which the movies are selected is the money that makes the difference or having some big names in the movie makes the difference br br hope to see more movies like this in the future
