a peachy postcard of newer york the thing i enjoyed most was being conceivable to watch this with my whole relatives and not cringe meantime for a stupid toilet humor stuffing to transpires it never do my teenagers liked it too my son for natasha henstridge and my daughter for michael vartan my wife and i commented that we could not recall the last time we could sit with the kids and all enjoy something this film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done the ending came with a twist which we all liked too if you are not just a cynical person and have are willing to let a story unfold then this is for you as a guy it takes a lot to hold my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did i recommend it and we need more of these films to watch
