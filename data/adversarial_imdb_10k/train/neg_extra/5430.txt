he's stocky, sweaty, slightly cross eyed and restless he stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert he claims that we the film viewers perceive the screen as a toilet bowl, and are all secretly wishing for all the s t to explode from the inside he's unanticipated and scary well \? come on, you could have guessed by now he's one of the leading philosophers of our age br br slavoj iek is both a narrating and a question of sophiefiennes'extraordinary new filmmakers, a pervert's guide to the cinema fiennes illustrates a feature long lecture by iek, and does so in two ways by providing exemplary film clips and putting iek on real (or reconstructed) locations from the movies he speaks about it's always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies (although revenge of the sith got here as well), but the main attraction of a pervert's guide is iek himself what makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again what is more outrageous, iek's views or iek's screen presence \? in a documentary by astra taylor (iek !, 05), slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent because, he claimed, he feels like he doesn't exist in the first place, the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly and talk he did, and how also a pervert's guide is dominated by his voice delivering perfect english in most crazy way, and making some astonishing points about the cinema br br what are those \? well, for example he sees chaplin's reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself (kind of alien force taking over the human being think the ventriloquist segment of dead of night 45) he says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects, not to provide us with them he identifies groucho marx as super ego, chico as ego and harpo as id he says a million other interesting things, and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him, so persuasive (and captivating) are his looks at some point i couldn't help but stare at his thick, scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath craving, of course, for more insights br br most notable are iek's readings of lynch and hitchcock (which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them) the cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of iek's lecture memorable and unlike others difficult to argue with, since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors this doesn't go for his reading of tarkovsky for example, upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality, dismissing precisely what's so remarkable in all tarkovsky (namely strong religious intuitions and images) br br the question isn't whether iek is inspiring and brilliant, because he is or whether fiennes film is worth watching, because it is likewise the real question is rather are iek views coherent \? one smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride, but after the whole thing is over, some doubts remain for example while considering vertigo (58) iek states that what's hidden behind human face is a perfect void, which makes face itself only a facade something of a deception in its own means however, when in the final sequence we hear about the ever shattering finale of city lights (31) as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another, it's hard not to ask what happened to the whole facade thing \? why should we grant chaplin's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive kim novak's of this same privilege in two bold strokes \? or maybe that incoherence might also be read in lacan's terms \? (the name of the notoriously unreadable french psychoanalyst is fundamental to iek's thought) the film has all the virtues of a splendid two and a half hours lecture lots of ground are covered, many perspectives employed, even some first rate wisecracks made (when iek travels on a melaniedaniels'boat from the birds 63 and tries to think as she did, he comes up with i want to f k mitch !) but it has also one shortcoming that isn't inherent to two and a half hours lecture as such it's almost obsessively digressive iek's yarn about how far are we from the real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn, but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of iek's perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on, changing subjects constantly overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant, cool, fizzing wave you're simultaneously taken by surprise, refreshed, in mortal danger and confused no end as you finish watching, your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you're already planning on re watching some films but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity br br the ultimate question is did iek lost it \? or haven't we even came close to the real thing \? once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment, we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other (not having any movies around to turn our faces to) i dare you all who will have enough guts to approach iek and defy him \? my guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life, you become a believer
