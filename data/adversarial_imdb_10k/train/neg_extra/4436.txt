this movie starts out hilarious from about the 15 second mark, and continues it throughout the movie i cannot recalling a scene where i didn't turn to look at people laughing with me he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed br br the comedic parts were peachy to see from actor not very big or popular as you can see people know like this flick it is currently rated 7 9 on imdb i think it should be in 250 lets put it this way i haven't seeing this funny of a cinema upon american pie or the original vacation see it if you want a laugh i give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb, great movie site
