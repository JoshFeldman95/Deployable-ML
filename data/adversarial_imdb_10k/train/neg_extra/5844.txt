splendid movies when i saw it have to stated one of my fave movies of all time i saw it like 8 times in the theater and took the dvd as i got older and endured it again i realized that the movie is average compared to movies that are known ad good comedys, this is nothing i meaning rock was hysterical in the movie and the whole shuffled with the racial something dislocation a scant constraint which is great also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking it's like most thought of a movie but also a marginal twist which is a very nice touch i like the movies broad however i give it a br br still a good 7 10 for me
