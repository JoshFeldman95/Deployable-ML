wow a trulyfantastic'trip'movie that has tons of super outlandish imagery, dark intended and a black, kinda strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world it's populated with a very cutie off globe bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds as with all cool fantasy, the wandering plot is secondary to the eye popping visuals and we observe a little cats and his zombie sister as they encounter assassinating, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish i'd never heard of it, but now i iove it probably as it reminded me of the freakish pencil work of american cartoonist bill plympton it's a demented delight for fans of odd, pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i'd miss something amazing simply put, it's'hellokitty'withoutthe'o'
