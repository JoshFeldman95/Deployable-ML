absolutely hilarious johnwaters'tribute to the people he loves most (baltimoreans) is a tortuous little ditty with suitably to look at and laugh at it's like being turned loose in a museum of kitsch ! i haven't laughed so much in a theater since serial mom i loved seeing old friends from the dreamland days, sharon nisep and susan lowe, back in front ofwaters'camera the cast is simply sumptuous (especially edward furlong and martha plimpton) uses the best elements of past waters atrocities (especially the underrated polyester) and plenty of new surprises made me sick, in a wonderful way thanks, john !
