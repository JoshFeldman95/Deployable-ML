ever wonder where the ideas for romance novels and other paper back released come from \? accordingto'jakespeed'they are based on real people, living out the adventures they write about and publish this movie is quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and skimpy clothes at the worst the language is is also not a problem, and the jokes are funny at all scale this isa'austinpowers'lookat'indian jones', without the over the top antics of michael myers i overly recommend this film for kids in the 10 to 15 range
