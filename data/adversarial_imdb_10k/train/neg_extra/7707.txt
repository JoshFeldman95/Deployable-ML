fido is a cute comedic that deserves wider recognition, especially considering the mainstream crap that is supposed to entertain us these days br br as has already been pointed out, this is nigh a real zombie film, but rather a scrumptious ridicule that employs the undead to point fingers while there are necessarily some bloody scenes, there is almost no gore and the way this movie is presented (feel good 50s style), i can't imagine anyone being actually scared or turned off by fido his fellow sufferers br br while the cast is generally good, i felt that moss and nelson stood out the humor is not in your face, but rather subdued there's a lot of attention to detail and i caught myself smiling benignly several throughout the movie this is certainly no masterpiece of cinema, but it doesn't strive to be instead, currie succeeds in delivering a heart warming black comedy
