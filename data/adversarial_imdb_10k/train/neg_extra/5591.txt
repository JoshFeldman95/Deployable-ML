i preferential this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff randell (played by p j soles) is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to visualize that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuff br br it was fun, emphatic, quirky and cool yes i'll admit that the ending is way way over the leading and far fetched but it doesn't aspect because it is fun this is a very jest movie it's sex, pot and rock n rocll forever br br i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i don't know if this is true or not
