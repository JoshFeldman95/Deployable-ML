stepdad of the pride was another of those adequate show that unfortunately don't have a very long lives and that is pretty sad, specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air (think in the simple life) i accept that are many similarities with this show and the simpsons, but despite the similarities, the show have it own merits the animation is just adequate, not impressive, but is okay the best are the character all the animals are very agreeable and funny, and even sigfried and roy had their moments the music was good, i hoped many of the songs br br even if the show isn't very original, i think that this had lots of potential like mission hill a show that isn't very famous but i liked a lot, this didn't have the appreciation that it deserved what a shame
