i recently got the chance to view the waterdance, and fairly liked it i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there, except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie, invalids in a ambulatory the story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman, which is a very pleasant story unfortunately, you don't get to see movies like that mon im not stuck in a time warp, im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but i really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there's much we can learn from old movies by old movies i mean anything from 1920 1998
