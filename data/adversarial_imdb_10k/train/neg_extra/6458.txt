initially, i have heard great things about this film, not least among the retro vintage scene and the stockings lovers who absolutely love bettie page and it did not disappoint shoot in very clean black and polar with sepia complement for key scenes, the filmmaking anticipates a documentary foreboding to the early life and career of bettie page br br there are many things i did not know about page firstly, there was the gang rape, later on, there is her early attempts at developing an acting career and then glamour pictures, firstly with a camera club peopled with men who can't get enough of her and later with the klaws, paula and irving, who despite their taking of bondage and fetish photos, come across as extremely pleasant and friendly people if only modern pornography producers were like that, perhaps better porn would be a consequence ! for the most part, the film is neither a diatribe against the evils of pornography but an attempt to show the kind of environment that existed in the 1950s for those producing fetish and nude pictures of women this environment was extremely repressive, perhaps in a good way because it meant that there was none of the'saturation'effect that we have today, when it comes to pornography it also appeared to be much less harsh page comes across as someone who enjoys her work and doesn't appear to be degraded by it in many of her photos she is seen tied up and gagged (and trying to hold a conversation), brandishing a whip with a flourish, thus exciting the photographers taking her pictures and seenin'initiationstyle'girlie bondage movies which look quite tame compared with the hardcore stuff we have now br br page never became an actress and instead deserted pinup when she was in her thirtiesfor'jesus christ' her belief in god and jesus never goes away, even when bound and gagged she still insists that she has been givena'gift'by god todo'this thing' seeing this film, i am more knowledgeable about page and in awe at her modesty, beliefs and demeanour she is one of a kind, compared with the identi kit clone blondes we have today and someone who can actuallysay'there is life after porn'
