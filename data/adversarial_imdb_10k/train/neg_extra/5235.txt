ea have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world the graphics of the game are noteworthy and also the voice recording is very professional i get this game april 2007 (two years after release), and i am still flabbergasted with the gameplay it's a shame that ea will no longer make 007 games br br i let this playing 10 10 for the levels it contains, especially the consulate level i would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over the only somethings i didn't like in the game is the russian boat level, it was too much pressure on the whole i like the game a lot ! !
