i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters, renaissance br br and firstly, that it looks as it ought to look aboys'adventure, renaissance is the tale of a cop's investigation in search of a missing young scientistilona tasuiev, the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company br br the tale of karas, ilona and bislane is, though much less known than sin city, the preferable movie, and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful (i have enriched my french comics collection last week, thoughi'm not so uptodate) the atmosphere, the music, the characters, their lines, the plot are all nice and endearing a parisian top cop, karas, is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medicalgenetic research, ilona tasuieva mildly hot blonde, whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable, i guess br br for me, an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series, renaissance, a marvelously beautiful cartoon, was like a replay of a wild wild west episodehere, a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological futuremore jaded and blase but, in a sense, as thrilling renaissance is not suspenseful nor does it look especially wellpaced but it's seducing and hypnotic moreover, it achieves sketching, albeit briefly, a world, a true worldand we will think about the avalon, nakata, jonas mueller, the tasuiev sisters, and goran, farfella, and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah i liked renaissance's feel, of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness, and also the professional, assured look among these new cartoons, this one and linklater's dick adaptation (the only and first dick adaptation ever) stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement br br i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and, when not conventional, vividly eerie (like the invisibility costumes) br br as advisable, the characters have exotic names, like bislane and farfella, mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment's world (goran and ilona and naghib) br br none seems to have noticed that renaissance's poster features a rourke look alikethat guy is marv which doesn't make it a sin city rip off, but not a paragon of originality either, and in fact there's more resemblance to the miller talenamely, the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society, the brio of the hero (in fact a cross ofwillis'character and rourke's persona in the previous movie) on the other hand, this cartoon breathes a more public air, a brim of straight adventurousness, and, in a word, it's like sin city for kidswell, naughtier kids i mean,'cause there's a bit of nudity on display to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic, even as cliches and common places of the futuristic more adultcomics'look true enough, and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there now it's also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn, so to each sin city, its renaissance i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales, a rather undemanding specialty
