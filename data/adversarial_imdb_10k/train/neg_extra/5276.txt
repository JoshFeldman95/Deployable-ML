if mulder was looking for his real parental here he is darren mcgavin, the first x files, pity it was only one season long the producers of this showing didn't know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came chris carter with what i call the tracked up to the night stalker, the x files both going go down as classics is my thoughts the three show opt the viewer to a tiers of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should showed in the x file olds later darin mcgavin, as agent arthur dales helping our two favorite hero, s solving cases paying homage to the man i think so, well done chris carter bringing back a forgotten tv show in the form of david duchovny as darren mcgavin if it wasn't for watching the x files and that particular show i would have never known about the night stalker
