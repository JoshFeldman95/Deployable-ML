this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions, muti billion dollar computer graphics, or highly over compensating actors and actress to make a good movie, all you need is a extraordinaire story line and plot which the master of all japanese films, akira kurosawa withdraw off admirably i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy kurosawas earlier works 10 10
