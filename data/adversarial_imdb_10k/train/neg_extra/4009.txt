the thought of sarah silverman having her own show worried me at first the films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off however, i was very surprised to see her true colors gleam in this comedy central bling i could possibly put her on par with the likes of amy sedaris in strangers with candy sarah's character is a true sociopath, very comparable tosedaris'jerri blank br br the one downfall of this show is its supporting cast her sister's character is good funny at times, but ultimately meant not to steal sarah's show however, the rest of the cast is extremely sub par in comparison br bri'm glad, though, that comedy central has given sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
