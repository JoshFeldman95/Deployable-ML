beach leave is mostly an wherewithal star trek affair nothing bad with the episode, though i simply think that this is not the best portraying of what the showing had to offer to fan it is lightweight entertaining, nothing more however,i'm appreciative to see that a tv show of this type had enough good sense to take a break from serious intergalactic conflicts in this episodes, spock decides to grant his crew some time off, and a landing party is beamed down to a planet that looks like the perfect place for a vacation as usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it appears to be there are some action and tense moments, but most of the story is played for laughs good, but unexceptional
