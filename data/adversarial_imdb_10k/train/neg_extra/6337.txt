both my friend and i thought this movie was well done we expected a light hearted comedy but would a full blown action movie with comic thrusts we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy i was dumbfounded with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a extraordinaire acting operating most of the supporting castings are veterans not first timers and they were solid we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and implemented remarks to all other about buyer this flick if you donen't absorbing rentals it for a agreeable lengths
