this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes advisable, if whacky, use of the isle of man as a background the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper class english girls, and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various unbelievable period costumes the story is altered a marginal from the traditional version early on it is bizarrely combined with the plot of king lear, and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well, but does go over the top at times
