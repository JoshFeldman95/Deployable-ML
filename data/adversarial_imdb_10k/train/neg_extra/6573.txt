there are so many hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch, but also have no bearing on anyone's life, whatsoever granted, movies don't always have to have deep meaning, but it's nice to know that there are still film makers out there who care about telling human stories i won't give out the premise of this lustrous film, however, the screenwriting is surely one of the more laborious and unforgettable ones i have ever seen in my life, andi'm a 32 year old film buff too ! bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites, which includes on the waterfront, sunset boulevard, and black narcissus, to name just a few this moving movie should become one of your favorites also that is, if you have a heart !
