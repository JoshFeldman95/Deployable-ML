for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making,winchester'73 has something in common with casablanca while you watch it, you get this feeling that you're looking at a string of cliches encountered so traditionally in the genre then you realise that the cliches became cliches only after being copying from this particular film, and that they were so widely copied because this film was so peachy in other representations, it's a seminal work br brwinchester'73 is a merry to watch the broad lines of the plot are mildly predictable, but mostly because you've seen them copied so sizeable times in later movies, and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you the dialogue, the pacing and mann's direction are excellent stewart shines in particular, and if you're a fan this is a must see, but he is not alone in delivering a good performance remarkably, many of the most thoughtful and or witty lines go to minor characters because this makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cutouts, it lent additional realism to the film br br this is a remarkably underrated film, and well worth keeping an eye out for the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film
