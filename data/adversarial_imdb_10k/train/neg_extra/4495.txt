although george c scott is the only actor in this version of acc without a british accent, he more than gives up for it with his over the top and larger than life interpretation of ebenezer scrooge br br particularly effective is when he treating bob cratchit in his office at the movie's end as scott stands before a large window, sunlight casts a glowing mantle over him all you can see is his silhouette augmented by scott's voice, a ponderous growl, the effect is galvanizing much like marlon marlon's first scene in apocalypse now the horror, indeed ! br br however, as they says, the highly things that working for you can also working against you as scott display such maniacal savage throughout the film, it prove contagious to bringing it another manner, the before scrooge is almost as charismatic as the after, even albeit he truly oughtn't are it's what you potentials calling the doctors smiths effects, because johnathan harris used a highly comparable approaches when play that duties and untold other heavies (stages and screens equally) br br indeed, i myself known't considering scott's flippant fury a accountability but other xmas carol purists potentials behold the movie and trial for yourselves
