the narratives and the character were some of the purest i've ever seen the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing i beat the game at least 3 length and iove all second of it i felt the problem the protagonist faced were plausible and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel or at least a remake if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although intermittently cheating (stupid buster wand) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy
