in what will probably find itself on my lists of fuller's strictest movies (that is, once i see more of them that just this and collision corridor), vans on southward pavement is a film calico where the femme fatale, as even as the manly protagonists, are not the stereotyped ones in the genre adore most of his other functioned, fuller pumped his own enjoys and the detection of new york style that is systematically absent in the hollywood noirs on a small budgets at least for the likes of darryl f zanuck fuller and his actors create people that are unlikable even in such a dark atmosphere the good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you even as they're looking for an extra buck br br richard widmark, jean peters, and thelma ritter are all terrific in the lead parts widmark is one only a few actors i can think of who could've really pulled off this character he's a little like bugs bunny, as he can be a wise ass who is a little sneaky on the other hand, the character of skip mccoy does have a set of values in his life he doesn't go into other people's affairs, and doesn't try and care about much of the working world outside of his little shack on the river, after being sent away for three years he slips up, unbeknownst to him, when he pickpockets a woman (peters) on the train, and lifts an item that's under the eye of the government it may have some secrets that could make him a lot of money but at what cost is the centerpiece of the film, as it involves stoolie moe (ritter is one of the finest, and most believable, character actors from the period), the woman's ex (a volatile kiley), and the police department br br aside from the thematic elements, which are told with a keen dramatic, journalistic style (as was fuller's previous position, along with boxer), the dialog is fresh and involving there's a spontaneity in many of fuller's camera moves and what a third act this is a lean, tight film noir that is worth checking out even if you're not familiar with fuller (it's comparatively less bizarre than some of his later works)
