personal taste rule when it exists to lecture about movies such as this irreplaceable little jewel modo back in the eighties, the early eighties, i discovered this movie, like so multiple circulated at the time, night squad bad manners or even king sorority the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you br br of course being of an age, movie like that i have already mentioned as well as thing like screwballs and the sizeable others, captured the imaginations, and mercifully disparate years once i even remember some with fondness and some with indifference the miscellaneous movie that aided retain my love of such genres as parody or pastiches br br made many years after the huge success of animal house and having seen how it had fared down through the years, i now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory, much like that of national lampoon's vacation br br to be honest, not everything that has carried the national lampoon logo has been a wild success, however to me class reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies, with instantly recognisable characters, such as the aloof bob spinnaker played to perfection by gerrit graham, so good in charles band's terrorvision still lingering in the past glories of his youth or how about stephen furst's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum hubert downs br br sweet as which makes me ponder as i already said, personal taste not withstanding people can be so cruel, so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its's peers within the comedy world it does have some merit being one of the earlier scripts penned by john hughes, who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work weird science as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great gary u s bonds br br what more can i say, it's a movie just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again
