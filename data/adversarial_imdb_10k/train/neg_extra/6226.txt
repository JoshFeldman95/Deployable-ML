gojoe is part of a new influx of japanese cinema, taking very creative directors, editors and photographers and working on historic themes, what the japanese convening period pieces gojoe is extremely creative in prescriptions of color, photography, and editing stellar, even the new wave of japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in kurosawa's samurai epics, or the zaitochi series another peachy example of this genre is onmyoji (2001) i would place director sogo ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave japanese directors other recent japanese period pieces i would highly recommend include yomada's twilight samurai (2002) and shintaro katsu's zatoichi the blind swordsman (2003)
