this movie was phenomenal it was full of notable imagery, good acting, and influencing subject subjected it would be very unadulterated to write it off as being too sentimental, but that is the sentimental this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots, but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details however, this movie wasn't created to explain every element of joseph smith's life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time
