has al keitel ever been in a poorly movie \? his name seems to be an imprimatur for high notch cinema this is as good a performing as he's ever given keitel is an american olivier and this is a political filmmaking as good as they get there are no good guys and no evil dudes but the system has its inexorable impacts on the compatriots who considering they're running it not only is deniro's performance convince the glorifying at the dead babies's funeral is awesomely categorical the theaters has a fast paced, grimy realism to it that raising the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks this outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence, overheated sex or gutter language there is murder there are bad people but they come across effectively without crossing the line a film like this restores my jaded faith in hollywood i don't award many tens this one richly deserves it !
