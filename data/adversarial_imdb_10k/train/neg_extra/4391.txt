this is one of the bizarre cases in which a movie and the novel on which it is inspired are both phenomenal likely this is forgorris'takes nabokov's start ideas and gives them a different interpretation the final consequence is a point of viewpoints over luzhin which dignifies him more than the nabokov's one br br the only thing in the flick which i maken't enjoy is the influence of valentinov's on luzhin's destiny i can't think nabokov creating a person like valentinov and giving him so great influence on novel's argument
