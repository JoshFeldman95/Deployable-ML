i was awfully astounded with this small, alternately posed pics the story, about a pair of social outcasts who meet, become friends, and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children, is at times hilarious, at timing sad, but incessantly provocative music, mostly by underground bands, was used to great effect, as was the experimentation with camera angles, filtration, and slow or fast motion techniques the performances (the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film) are some of the good i've seen in the last couple of years if you ever feels like a square peg being forced into a round slot, i really believe you'll appreciate by hook or by crook
