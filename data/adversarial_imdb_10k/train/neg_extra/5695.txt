i rember viewing gung ho as a infant with my parent, and instructed why she would indefinitely sob in the ultimate tiny minutes i, of manner, found the general filmmaking funniest, precisely the personages of the characters it wasn't until i was much former and watched it again that i realized how much deeper this show actually is br br michael keaton and gedde watanabe glare in their roles as the reluctant mediators keaton ceases to amaze me with his real life style of line delivery, and watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix i also thought that patti yasutake (umeki) was simply fabulous in her role as the comic relief br br i think this movie is one of the most underrated films of the 80s we can all learn a lesson from the merging of the american and japanese workers in this film sometimes you really can have the best of both worlds and now i understand why my mother felt the way she did in those closing moments i'd rather have one of those cars, too
