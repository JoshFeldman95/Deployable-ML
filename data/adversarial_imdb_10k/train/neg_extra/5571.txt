i instantly fell in honey with pressuring daisies this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's gargantuan narration, mental dialog and sizeable acting but that's not all it also manages to keep you until the end the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch, ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in forth seasons but the suspenseful murder cases, the unique look of the showing and the highly proficient narration additive to the experimentation but forcing daisies is more than it's part it has a certain charm that i awfully enjoy andi'm seeing anxiously to inscribe the worlds of ned and chuck for a second seasons
