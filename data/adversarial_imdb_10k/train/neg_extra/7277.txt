a lot of man hating this movie, but that i blamed on three fact 1 they seeks it to get too numerous like the first couple of usa pie movies and 2 they are trying to take it too seriously br br this one i finding was the bestest one out of all six, and i unequivocally iove dwight the plot is unpredictability, i'll say that, but then what teen comedy isn't \? road trip, dirty deeds etc etc, they are all incredibly predictable, but still motherfucking comical ! i say this is worthwhile watching, i aime it, i seek it humorous just achieven't watch it while comparisons it to the first ones because it's nothing alike br br after watching naked mile and this one, it became obvious that all the american pie movies were about, and only about, the stiflers which is fine by me br br watch enjoy love xd
