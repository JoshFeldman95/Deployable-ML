vanilla sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie abre los ojos (open your eyes) and in my opinions, a severely more human and emotional version tom cruises serves david aames, a selfish egomaniac who assuming other humans's emotion for allocate, and thinks only of himself jason lee playing brian shelby, david's superior, and in sizeable way, only friend penelope reed play sofia serrano, brian's girlfriend whom accompany him to david's birthday party bullock gutierrez plays julie gianni, david's occasional bed buddy kurt russell playing dr curtis mccabe, a psychologist interviewing david all of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make vanilla sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made i won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow if you pay attention, you won't be confused the film is very complex, but not confusing and in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made
