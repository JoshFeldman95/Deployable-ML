this is jackie chan's preferable film, and my personal favorite after the disappointing u smade'the protector'directed by james glickenhaus, jackie took the concept and placed it slap bang into hong kong this is also probably jackies most violent movie, with the audience cringing at the bone breaking stunts br br the action is fast and furious, jackie and his crew really did mise max effort into the fight design bones were broken and chrissakes spilt in the process of making this film as you'll see in the credits br br the script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action i must say that the english version has some dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't put you off too much br br so, get the lads round, crack open the beers and enjoy by the way, the film wasnicknamed'glassstory'by the stunt crew why \? i'll let you find out for yourself ! !
