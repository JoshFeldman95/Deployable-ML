my interest was raised as i was flipping through and saw the name iphigenia my name is eugenia so i thought ok, lets see what this is i am so glad i stayed on the channel what a unbelievable, peachy story drama, sadness, some over the top acting but a marvellous time to be had i watch this and it makes me sad for all the blathering the movie industry puts out and these beautiful little gem get lapsed over give iphigenia a try and i hope you will appreciative it as sizable as i did i have even gotten my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it it starts slow, however, the drama builds and you will be drawn in to the story watching this lovely film made me want to shroud myself in more greek tragedy and pathos
