massive multiple chills down the spine !i'm surprised there's people who didn't like it ! i saw it at 10o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff ! and i've seen hundreds of thrillers horror movies ! for crying out loud,i'm 22 ! ! ! i mean, ok, voice acting, not particularly good, probably even b movie ish but the veritable look of terror, the sound effects, the flow ! from the very start, hitting you again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorising scenes ! so many cliches yet none fails to surprise scare ! you know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, boo ! and you still jump off the chair grab a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend over and don't watch it at night ! hats off to the japanese !
