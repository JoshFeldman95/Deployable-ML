this is the optimum film text of dicken's routine retold i've looked it over and over on vhs, and recently acquired the dvd version, which is guises for tv (not wide screen) what i concludes appealing about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films shows in north america since 1984 my worse surprise is edward woodward, the equalizer, as the ghost of christmas present
