i seemed this film earlier thu, and i was shocked at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters it didn't feel like a film it felt more like a documentary (the part i liked best) the leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year old girls i know br br all in all, a very agreeable film for those who enjoy independent films
