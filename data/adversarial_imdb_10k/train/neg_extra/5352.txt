although this movie has some weakness, it is worth seeing i chose it because of the cast, and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past both portray very troubled people, complete with warts, but exert them likeable because of their humanity the storytelling is poked, but it is the performances that soar bonham carter's jane is a unbelievable achievement, whose quest for romance opened my eyes to facet of being disabled that i had not thought of before, but was interesting as satisfactorily for other reasons i watched the movie completes too abruptly, but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending (see stepmom) the very real english setting added to my enjoyment it was england in the 90's, both urban and rural, without being depressing
