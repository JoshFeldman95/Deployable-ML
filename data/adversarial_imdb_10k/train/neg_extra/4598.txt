generally speaking, the plot was much better than i was expecting the laugh track was a stung annoying at lengths and did tend to get in the way however, there were enough real chuckles in this episodes to make up for it my lousiest unforeseen was finding some of the good lines and situations were not showings in the trailers spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions, but his character comes across fairly well in the pilot there is is enough eye candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun
