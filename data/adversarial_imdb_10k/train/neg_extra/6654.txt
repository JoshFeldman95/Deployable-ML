i would give this show a tens out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes you people are so damn hypersensitive it is inane ! so quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes, yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist, pig headed crap like well, duh, some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women so disgusting abortion jokes are great because, really, who takes abortion seriously anyways \? at leasti'm not a bore son i hear that reba mcentire and sarah silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together talk about a movie of the year !
