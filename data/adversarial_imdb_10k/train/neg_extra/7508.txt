i really iike this movie, yes, i know it was fairly far fetched, there is no way that shelby car could have managed to stay on the road as well as the 540i with all it's traction control and other gizmos but other than that the whole film was well put together cage was unbelievable as usual and the rest of the cast were also pretty good with the exception of the brit bad guy, he was a little too much don't you think \? anyway, great cinematography, great cars and great behaving i for one made safe my vehicular was stranded and appalled in my remotely controlled garage that night)
