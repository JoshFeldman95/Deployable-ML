the covert ray is an unbelievable display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi karloff pulls off a smooth performance as a sullen and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others, even his wife his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid br br lugosi plays the consummate professional, who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone, but still seems to have no real close friends this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it dramatically even it is hard, however to listen his accent and believing he is frenchman brit ab the largest problems with the film was that it was all bases on junk science but, in a manner, even the junk science renders it working suitably because the thoughts and theory are totally senseless, they are as pertinent nowadays as they were when the film was handed and they are also as forward reaches and perpetually going constituted ab br this is a abundantly lovely film to look again and again i seen it perhaps 5 time this weekends and i could readily sitting through it three more time the acting is marvellous and the sciences is joking i eminently recommending it
