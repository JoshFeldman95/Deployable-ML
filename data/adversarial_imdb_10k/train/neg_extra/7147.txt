thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently (thought i'd missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest) paris, jet'aime is a collection of 20 shortened films (about 5 mins each) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris br br one of my fave segmentsis'parcmonceau'by alfonso cuarn (great expectations, harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban), which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte br br the coenbrothers'' tuileries'starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! juliette binoche and willem dafoein'place desvictoires'was haunting br br for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress druggiein'quartier des enfantsrouges'to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant br br elijah wood as a vampire victimin'quartier de lamadeleine'was pretty surreal, while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven's'pre lachaise' br br natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boyin'faubourg saint denis' but despite the many portrayals of young love, a more mature execution by gena rowlandsin'quartierlatin'was equally aww inducing br br this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of br br there are also a number of memorable quotes one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days in pretending to be a man in love, he became a man in love
