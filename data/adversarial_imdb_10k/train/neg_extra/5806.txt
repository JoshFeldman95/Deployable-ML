i've read reviews of kerching on imdb, and frankly, i've not seen one positive review, until now i definately adore kerching kerching is about a teenage boy named taj lewis, in order to make 1, 000, 000 for his mother, he sets up a website called rudeboy the website offers a fate of interesting things, if only taj, and his 2 buddies danny and seymour can stop taj from getting exposed i find this shows fairly funny and i enjoy watching it the acting is o k, but it can unequivocally be better, the character are giggle, especially danny spooner, taj's friend, his stupidity is what makes him funny and taj's other friend seymour also carlton, the owner of thecafe'e called the chill we never see him, we only hear him taj's younger brother omar, and his older sister missy is funny too and missy's best friend kareesha so many times taj's has almost got exposed, almost as well as the comedy, the drama in kerching such as love life and the loss of loved ones makes this programme great
