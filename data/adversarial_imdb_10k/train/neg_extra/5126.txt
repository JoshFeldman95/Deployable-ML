i really cared the reunion a lot ! i would have rated it a 10 if they ha holds hassie and little luke there wasn't even a mention of where they are today or why they didn't participate in the reunion they were very popular characters and i think it was a mistake not to give an explanation about their lack of appearance br br anyway, i was glad that tnn tumbled the series again ! i hectare been searching for episode for ages and what a happier to constitute capable to tapes the whole series (i may recieve squandered a narrow timeframe) jenny hanahan
