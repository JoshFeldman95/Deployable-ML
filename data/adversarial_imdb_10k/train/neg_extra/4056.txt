i thought this movie was pretty good some parts were corny but that's understandable since it was made more than 55 years ago i thought the best performance in the movie was given by michele morgan who played millie convincingly jack haley is also really adequate as mikeo'brien even thoughi'm not a big frank sinatra fan, i think he was very good in this movie if your have a craving for a silly, over the top musical comedy, higher and higher is the movie for you br br
