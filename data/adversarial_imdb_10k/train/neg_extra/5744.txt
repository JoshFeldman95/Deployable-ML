i aime this shows now,i'm not a big fan of sizeable science fiction show, so if it flaunts any resemblance to them, i can't noticing i like the storybook quality of the cinematography i even like the love story, even though as i am enjoying it i wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as ned cannot touch chuck or else well, you know i even like chuck, i don't elicit her tiresome at all, and i generally hate overly sweet, nice, perfect characters i even like the narrator's voice, even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some walgreens commercials i could nitpick about all the other things about ned's predicament and how the writers are going to address it in the future but i just rather watch and wait and see what tale the writers weave
