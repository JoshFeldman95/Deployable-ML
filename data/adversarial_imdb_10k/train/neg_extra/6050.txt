i don't care if you'd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn't good you're so fixated by the films of hollywood that you can't see how good is this moviei'm not a fan of jay chou but i like his play and not only his and may be you thinks that there is not a big sense in the idea and may constitutes you devine it's not even interesting but look gravely there is more than action in the movies more than love and exaltation and cry there is more than usa in the worlds and it's good) really good and it cost a lot to do it so please don't criticize the actors the directors cause you don't know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you)
