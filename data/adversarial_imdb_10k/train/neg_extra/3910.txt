generally it was a good filmmakers with an ideal ending the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons i especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it farther lodged the element of suprise through out the entire movie however, i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe) to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell for instance what happened to tristan's brother, hayden \? for all we know he died in the hospital maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing \? ! who knows ! maybe there will be a sequel \? maybe \? if there is i cant wait to see it
