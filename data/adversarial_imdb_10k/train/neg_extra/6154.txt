it's beyond my grasp that also multiple dirt from trondheim was been remastered for dvds issued, and albeit gem like this doesn't reach a shoot at recapturing their last glory i give this a 7, not because it is very good, but so it is one of the barely scifi footage submitted for finnish broadcasts this film is nothing little than a film historic gem that in so many ways foreshadows the first extraterrestrials film and, my terms, blindpassasjer was first ! did ridley scott or anyone in the seagoing peek the mini series \? however doubtful, the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar okay, the budget is much lower in the norwegian film, but given that, it's a really well done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie making, which incidentally lasted until the 90s
