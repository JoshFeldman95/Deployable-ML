i prematurely bought this bluray because it assumed srk and aishwarya rai on the covers and i felt, hey ! another film starring aishu and shah rukh, little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she bartering with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance it's a film about transformations, ignorance, coming of age, stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie it's actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day, dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the songis'ishqkamina' (loosely translated as love's a bitch !) and it is just plain smoking hot ! don't miss it
