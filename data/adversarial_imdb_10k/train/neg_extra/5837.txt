it appears that there's no middle ground on this flick ! most of it takes place in a dream and, like most dreams, it's often foolish and laughable it's also a peachy production with some great songs and fine performances, especially by our angel br br jeanette's deadpan, unknowing insult and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious, and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight at one point, she gets to sing a snippet from carmen, followed by the final trio of faust (holding a lapdog, for some strange reason), then aloha oe on the beach ! br br it's a surreal comedy tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove
