though i saw this movies years ago, its impact has never left me craig rea's depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving his suffering at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable everyone in the casting is breathtaking from sutherland who effort to accommodate him and provide methodology for the policeman to coherent their efforts, to the troubled citizens x whatsoever moment when we are bombarded with storytelling of mass murderers, i think of this film and the tiring work the personas do who try to find the murderers
