first things first ! this isn't an action movie although there is a number of action in it ! i think you can compare it to american sports movies ! where a team of very bad participant succeed in the unthinkable, winning a game or tournament beyond expectation ! in this case it isn't about football or baseball, but jujitsu ! in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing ! but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life ! it is nice to see them struggle and training ! i was flummoxed how funny this movie was ! from start till the end you will laugh your pants off ! the young korean actors are very convincing ! go see this wonderful feel good movie !
