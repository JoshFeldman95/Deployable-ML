one of the most heart overheated exotic filmmaking i've ever seemed brit brit the teen daughter is an amazing performer stellar performances by her (doggie), the old man (the king of conceal), and liang (the abode boddhisatva) br br (spoiler) the deplorable therapy of children, especially females is troubling br br loved the music the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story br br this is a must glance enjoyable family film, although not for very young schoolchildren would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version
