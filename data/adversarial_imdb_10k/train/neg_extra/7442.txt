i first saw this at a foreign film festival it's a beautifully paced nail biter about a plot to relieve the estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold it's all shot in a chalk, grainy style that hollywood rarely uses but it captures the atmosphere of the newly liberating baltic states beautifully (note tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when i was there) br br there's a lot of humor and some romance, too i don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so i'll just say this heist filmmaking booting from a huge screenplay, and the instructing and depictions are major cleft darkest in tallin is merely the quickest and most audacity racked examples of its genres i'd tabled it up against rafifi, topkapi, and it's miles ahead of the recent sea's 11, albeit (wilfully) not as gloss rents or get it now
