this is a unimaginably redoubtable and unfolds movie there are many plot and turns the story or the director initiation point stamp on the murdering queue or assumptions felony recruited by negro humans this film is very well aimed by ernest glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent strong performance of sean connery and ed harris if you liked this one don t miss true crimes or the hurricane my chick and me gave 8 10
