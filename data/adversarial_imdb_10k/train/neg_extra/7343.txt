first of all i endured this flick without recognising anything about it i just knows that joshua schumacher did it and that was enough for me a friends and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night film festival which is a lot of different movies depicts after hours the festival pretty much emphasis in showing movies that wouldn't otherwise be shown in danish theaters br br anyway my friend and i went to seeing it and we were baffled at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cable with our emotions, we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book br br the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative dogma 95 which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier (dancer in the dark) br br in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g i joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home br br also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i haven't seen him before but i can't wait to see more of him br br lars p helvard
