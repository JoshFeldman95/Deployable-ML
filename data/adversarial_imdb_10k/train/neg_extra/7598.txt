i thought that the sentinel was going to be a mediocre movie when i finally saw it, i took a good surprise the movie isn't considerable thing but it's very delights and the action scenes are very okay done this movie reminded me tv instalment like 24 or alias it's very similar to that series and it reminded me too, to the wolfgang petersen's thriller in the line of fire if you're going to expect one of the most original and and one of the lousiest thrillers in the history of movies, you gonna remain disappointed but if you go with little expectations, you will enjoy the sentinel br br rating 7
