although cinderella isn't the obvious choice for a sequel i love jaq and gus so i didn't hesitate the format of the mice writing a book for cinderella was an directed one i enjoy writing stories myself and hope children will be encouraged by this the three stories are cute amusing, although the songs were forgettable jaq and dudes were my favourite properties but i also liked seeing lucifer, bruno, the mice chorus and all the rest mop pom proved the irreproachable companion for mephistopheles and i preferable the governess a sequel implemented suitably for a changeover my rating 8 10
