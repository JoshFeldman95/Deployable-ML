when i saw this animation for first time (i was 15 maybe) i was awfully flabbergasted ! it has completely different style compared to the japan animation and i kinda like it more tho whole impression of the movie is more sinister and dark the colors are not that colorous the characters don't talk much, there are no lengthened and boring conversations of this and that (like in ghost in the shell) with its dark pictures, views of strange beasts and sense of magic, it looks like one of those ancient scandinavian narrative, full of violence and horrendous creators, enthralled forests and deep caves, dwelled by dragons, throlls, orks and one mysterious hero to stop evil
