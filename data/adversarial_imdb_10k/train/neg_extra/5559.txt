i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised the story is a unassuming strange sometime but unmitigated i think it hectares an acceptable credibility the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying song is used to induce a a bit of patriotic evoke habitual to us movies this may not have the good movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to expect more similar ones in the future
