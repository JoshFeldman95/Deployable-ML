this movie should not be compared to the sting, or other caper heist fraud game films what makes it such a peachy movie experience is what it has to say about relationships, deceit and trust it's also a fairly cutting critique of psychiatry, given that the female protagonist is a shrink who is so easily deceived and then acts out in such a primitive manner in the finale has mr mamet had an unfortunate experience in therapy \? highly, hugely recommendations !
