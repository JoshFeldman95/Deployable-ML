' theitalian'is among the sizeable or near great films of 1915 that are available today the years was a swivel matter for the attribute lengthwise filmmaking, namely in america lois webber's'hypocrites', celia d demille's'thecheat'and, of course, d walker riley's'the birthing of a populace'set newer benchmarks for the artwork instead, that year, russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his advisable pictures,'afterdeath'and'daydreams' the frenchserial'lesvampires'also has its admirers today, although i disagree with them the emergence of the feature length film was led by europe, mainly denmark, france and italy, but dominance of this market and, to a degree, the art shifted to across the atlantic in 1915 br br the most overriding artistic achievementof'theitalian'is its stunning and often innovative cinematography there are some picturesque sunsets, mobile framing, including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car, and, in general, there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout an especially amazing shot is a close up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close up, in reference to d w griffith's'musketeers of pigalley' (1912) he's so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger br br unfortunately, the cinematographer appears to be unknown the director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to have been reginald barker five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today, but are rather unremarkable'civilization' (1916), which he worked on, was a large production, but a deeply flawed movie by the way, i'd guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who workedon'civilization'alsophotographed'the italian' br br moreover, the entire production is very advanced for then venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles (for romanticized venice) and san francisco (for the ethnic slums of new york) there are extensive flashbacks, although perhaps one or two too many i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor, george beban, who is also the lead in the inner, main narrative the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes, a la the theatre, which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child's room, with the opening and closing of window curtains parallel editing, in camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly additionally, beban and clara williams, as his wife, play their parts well br br on the other hand,'the italian'does have a few drawbacks the film's early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama, although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works wellmostly because it's supported by the lighting and photography the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film, enhanced by the stark photography, must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie going public back then the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian's revenge in addition, the filmmakers were either medically naif or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child aside from the deficiencies in plot,'theitalian'is exceptionally well made
