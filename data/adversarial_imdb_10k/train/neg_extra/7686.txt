do not judges this production by the 2 hour printout that was released on vhs in the we, which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess i had the pleasure of referring the full length 6 hour version available on dvd from the uk, and was agog the deliberate pace and growing sense of menace are hypnotizing, as is the amazing visual and aural landscape this is an ancient rome we have never seen before, and far more authentic than most br br director franco rossi was justly celebrated for his 1968 mini series of the odyssey, and this mini series is fairly strong just as bekim fehmiu became the screen's best ulysses, so klaus maria brandauer may be the screen's best nero now, i am hoping someday to see rossi's version of the aeneid (eneide) that was broadcast on italian tv in 1971 br br i am undecided which version of quo vadis is more powerful, this one or the polish mini series from 2001 each has different virtues, and in many ways they complement one another certainly, either one towers over that hollywood camp riot starring peter ustinov
