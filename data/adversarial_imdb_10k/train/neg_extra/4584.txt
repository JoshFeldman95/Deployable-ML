even besides ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in pertaining to nazis's lives and yes, this is dramatised, but critical robert carlyle play hitlers during his later aging, during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany, including the night of the long knives this tv film (also a two part mini series) indicate how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power, e g the financial disaster of 1930 br br the series follows hitler and little else, conversely from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl all in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography most actors are portrayed in half body shots which (for me) makes for a theatrical stance, not cinematic the tempo is at times drowsy, and the film does suffer from it, being approximately 2, 5 hours long
