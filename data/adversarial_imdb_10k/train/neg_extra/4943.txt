this is a quirky movie that the brits do so well low budget, cameo type roles, satisfactorily executing the story is a little weak, a before remarried judi dench decides to round up the blondebombshells'a all (well almost all) girl band who performed during the war in london the obligatory son daughter who thinks she's gone potty i did like the routed the filmmaking lets young people see that they don't have a monopoly on feelings, love and even lust ! that the old wrinklies can have a good laugh too judi dench was funky as always, a pity we didn't get to see more of the other blonde bombeshells, the end was a little rushed i thought i kept thinking as i watched that david jason would have made an even better patrick than ian holm, although he was quite adequate as the transvestite drummer all in all a cheery movie well worth a night in with the girls)
