i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too underage to appreciate all of al's subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much yet when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan, especially of his earlier work, you will thoroughly cherishes this film it is done in the mtv esque rockumentary habits and proclaims a veritable (but sometimes exaggerated) tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985 you will love it if you like his brand of humor and, more importantly, his music
