this was a prefered of my childhood i can remember considering it on televisions and tantalizing to it each occasion now thati'm raised up and have a kid of my own, i desiring to establish him to this customary movie we adhered it yesteryear friday, and he wanna it during abu's tussle with the giant spider, my son's hand plummeted over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared is he would bludgeoned the spider, poppa \? just watch, you'll see he has no historical frame of references to speak of (eight years old), so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma br br i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief, and not the grown up king in fact, if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit, the king is the thief's sidekick, not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative, adventurous young boys br br it's definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve, my son will findit'corny'or whatever word the next generation will be using by then the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented, why does ahmad love the princess \? because the narrative demands it the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy (repeatedly) for the clueless, love struck deposed king is equally improbable but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses, fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous, as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his (stolen) magic carpet, seeking some fun, and adventure at last !
