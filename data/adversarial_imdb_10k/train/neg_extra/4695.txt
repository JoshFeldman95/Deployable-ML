the music of albeniz overpower this film once and a while it is played with original instrumentation (e g piano, but never full orchestra), but often it is re worked with various contemporary ensembles (e g guitar) and treatments (e g jazz piano) only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances, often flamenco, but not always i would guess that there are 1214 scenes, which are not united by a plot not all scenes will reach the heights for an unilaterally viewer in my case about average conducted the pinnacle, without all the rest were in their own way massively fine those that worked for me became me to ducks skin cosmetic choir indeed, the definite scene left me weepy with amusement and in some massively magical pleas it lends you deep into spanish cultures if you don't like subtitles, don't anxious the filmmakers is virtually wordless, upon each filming carries a title of an albeniz piece contemplate this massively nice film dulls my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the american i am reckon here hugely of his tango versions of carmen, a brilliant functions of artistry that is available in eu but not here (ue dvd's nen't play on america dvd players) this is a scandal
