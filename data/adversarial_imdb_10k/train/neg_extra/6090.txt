as someone who's never been into sport, it appears like it would are arduous for me to gain into the football (or as we americas inexplicably calls it, football) themed bend it like beckham but i oughta say, this was one coolest cinema ! anglo indian jesminder bhamra (parminder nagra) and her wasp boyfriend julie paxton (keira knightley) oi to toying footballs (oh,i'm abandoning to say it the british and globe form) and just amore football player david beckham but jesminder's traditional sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked out description of football early in the movie) okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliche in that sense, but you gotta love this movie ! and if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of bend in football don't worry, the movie explains it (i'd also never heard of david beckham prior to this movie) and we all know that keira knightley hit it big a few months after bilb came out in the states, she starred in the equally cool pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl
