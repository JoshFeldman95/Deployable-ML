pages 3 is a peachy movie the storytelling is so improvements and outlandish not once throughout the film gotten i find myself staring off into space konkana sen was a good job in the movie, although i think someone with more glamour or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did do a great job all the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie along boman irani could a great job there is one thing that stands out in this movie the story it is great, and very realistic, it getsn't overcame around the bush it is unimaginably straight dispatched in sending out its messaging i think more movie like this should be made, i am sick of watching the same candy floss movies over and over, they are getting hard to digest now everyone should watch page 3, it is a great film just my 2 cents)
