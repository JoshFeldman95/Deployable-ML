i suck at gratuitous boob references, soi'm just going to write a plainly flat (no pun intended) review i love elvira, not in ai'm going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way, but suffice to say i think she rock the movie is served like a 50's horror film only alot more fun, look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean what relay glistens through in the movie is elvira's (or should that be cassandras) absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8, and have seen it contless times since i realy should get around to buying a copy, the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free br br p s another great performance from edie mcclurg (chastedy pariah) an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
