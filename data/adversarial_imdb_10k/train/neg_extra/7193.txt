1st watched 8 29 2009 7 out of 10 (dir sidney franklin) well informed count of farmers in china and their rebounds to notoriety and struggles with what mother nature laying at them this movie is based on an award winning novel and narrates a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl the movie does a good posting of keeping your interest despite a marginally hammy performance by the lead contributed by pul muni it chronicles, yun longer (the ascribe played by muni) and how he collaborate the land, purchased more land, anyway becomes awfully rich but then returns to the land where he originally commenced the relationship between him and his wife, played by luise rainer, is the main thread of the story (besides the land itself) and despite the obvious non chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people it's obvious that mgm used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it the scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it's pulled off pretty well
