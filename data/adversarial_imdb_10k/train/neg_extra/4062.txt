went to witnessing this finnish film and i've got to say that it is one of the preferable films i've seen this year the intrigue is made up of 5 6 different stories, all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town the stories come together very nicely in the end, reminding, perhaps, a bit of the way tarantino's movies are made most of the actors performed very well, which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type i especially enjoyed the acting by sanna hietala, the lead actress, and juha kukkonen i noticed btw that imdb has enjoys the misleading info about sanna her named, as you capable ha understood in my reviewing), is not heikkila, but hietala
