i think this movie had to be fun to make it, for our it was hilarity to watch it the actors look like they have a fun time my girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors not very much do we get to have psychotic amusing with a movie that is horror make i see a batch of scary movies and i would watch this one all jointly once more, or more because we laugh together if this actors make other scary movies i will watch them the thicker mad man thats chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man he make us laugh together the most i would give this movie a high score if you ask me br br i don't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors, but the main boy is cute the actor with the grand chest has to be not real they doesn't look to real
