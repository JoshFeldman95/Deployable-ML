i had fun watching red eye it's not a mainstay, but it's well aimed and institutionalized cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are irreproachable in the role yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but donnie craven gave it a ok pace at least not another scream with the usual college killer it's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character particularly from a film maker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released theatrically good job !
