seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a nutty hanoi vets trampa infernal is a pretty zany mexican slasher that reminds me a lot the zero boys the film is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck unfortunately there is not much gore, so fans of grand guignol will be disappointed however if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look mexican horror flicks are quite obscure (i have seen only alucarda and don't panic), so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher my rating 7 out of 10 highly recommended
