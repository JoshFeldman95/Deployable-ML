i must admit, at first i wasn't awaiting anything good, at all i was only expecting a cheesy movie promoting gackt's and hyde's image, buti'm glad to say it has much more to offer ab br yes, the acting is not that great, but it wantton't suck either, all the casting's bah discipline and they bring enough strength to their characters effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough br br what really hooked me up was the kernel of the storyline, although it merges fantastic elements, it also displays a crude actuality the developing of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really got on to me and i think that's the key of this movie it puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst br br it fulfills any expectations for a good drama i would definitely recommend it to everyone
