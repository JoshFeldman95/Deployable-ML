i agree that capital city should be on bluray i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in loves with rolf saxon as hudson talbot it was nice to peek america who efforts abroad in london in the financial industry for a changeover i loved rolf in this roles and sweetheart each other featured that he has been in i can't watching the appears only was 13 episodes i prefer william armstrong as hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series when they released this showed in the new york city area, it was incessantly lateness at night or at off juncture the shows is less than an hour long i felt this shows ought have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting i didn't care for sylvia but missed the actress, julia phillips lane in the previous season i felt this show took chances and often it worked it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british i liked watching julia ormond in an early role i felt this show should have lasted longer i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america
