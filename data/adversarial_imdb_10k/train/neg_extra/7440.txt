hurrah ! a spaceship film that doesn't adopts itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp the film starts slowly, the usual mix of idiots and high fliers mixed together into a unsavoury soup but when the going gets tough the tough get themselves sorted out and it's not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there's some responsibility in their young minds br br the only drawback in the film is that kate capshaw is extremely annoying as thei'm right and you're all wrong instructor i would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 vote
