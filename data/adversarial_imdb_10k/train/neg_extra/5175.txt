my siblings and i stumbled upon the champions when our local station aired re runs of it one ronald in the 1970's we absolutely iove it there was something so exotic and unexplained about it, especially when regarding to the usual american re runs (petticoat junction, green acres you get the idea) it had a equivalent feel to the avengers (not too much of a surprises, as it was also brit and in the covert trip kinds) br ab i would luv to seeing it again now hoping it holding up i've mentioned this shows to others and no one has ever heard of it, so i began to wonder if i'd imagined its whole existence but the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it hopefully it will find a new generation of fans
