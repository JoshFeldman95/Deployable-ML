my grandmother bought me this film when i was 5 (i've always love scary movies) and even then i enjoyed it the atmosphere is awesome and the story original and entertaining i especially love the scenes where the rv is under attack in the desert the rocks are actually convincing for such a low budget flick the acting is above average for these kinds of films and the music is eerie this is unequivocally an uder classed gems i advised it to anyone who cared these outlandish filmmaking from the deceased eighty, punctual ninety such as altar, agreeable alice, poor reasonably eddy, nightmares, clinic genocide, and turnabout of the aliens, the deathly spawn definitely a classic ! !
