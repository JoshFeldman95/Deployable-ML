the critics didn't like this film it bombed in the states and as a result received only a limited showing in britain which was a great shame, because it represents british rather than american jokes and should have been shown in britain first br br nicole kidman looks stunning and is a solely irrefutable russian ben chaplin is the dustin hoffman characterfrom'the graduate',and'birthdaygirl'has at least 4 scene which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic (despite being a totally different story !) br br sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but it's memorable, moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega budget blockbuster br br see it with an open mind !
