i am a kung fu fan, but not a woo fan i have no interest in mobster movies filled with over the top gun play now, martial arts that's beautiful ! and john woo surprised me here by producing a overly funny kung fu movie, which almost has too much fighting, if such a thing is possible ! this is good stuff br br many of the fight scenes are much adequate (and some of them are less good), and the main character are amusing and agreeable the bad guys are a tib too unbelievably evil, but entertaining none the tiniest you gotta see the sleeping wizard ! ! he can only fight when he's asleep it's hysterical ! br br upon repeated viewings, however, last hurrah for chivalry can tend to get a little boring and long winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good hence, i rate it only a 7 out of 10 but it really is almost an 8 br br all in all one of the better kung fu movies, made smack dab in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime all the really good kung fu movies are from the mid to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from thelate'60ies andearly'70ies (andearly'80ies, to be fair)
