this is a preferable adaptation of the book than the one with paltrow (although i cared that one, too) it isn't even numerous that beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better davies is a master at adapting austen for filming, and the production values here are very good it's not quite as glossy as the hollywood treatment, but it's near, and i thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
