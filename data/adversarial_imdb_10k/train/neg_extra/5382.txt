full house came to me when i was about 9 i remember seeing re runs of america's funniest home videos with bob saget, and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called fullest domicile one day, i was cheerful enough to catch an episodes while visiting family it didn't emerges too curiosity at first, but as i watched more and more, ever midnight at 9 00, i would just be even into it br br this show effectively renders you want to se there yourself, hang out with the girls, go places with them, and maybe even join in their little family sing alongs br br the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages there will be some parts that are more for adults, then parts that are meant for kids, so that the whole family will enjoy it no matter how cheesy it can be, it's still a great show, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone br br 10 10
