the item about my grandparents is a wonderful cinematographers about relationships first and foremost an adult son and his father, but also that son with his wife, his sisters and his mother paul reiser has written a semi autobiographical movie about his relationship with his father the movie is funny, depressing and thought caused it led me to re evaluate my own relationship with both my now deceased father and my adult son peter falk is excellent as paul's father the role could not have been good cast i hoped that both mr falk and mr reiser are confirmation in next year's movie awards for their attempt schmidt for his efficacy and reiser for his screenplay
