the stories is about a little girl growing up in colonial africa, but it is so muy more than that br br anyone growing up in the south would experience the same things a desire for another, one of a different race, that cannot be consummated even a look is forbidden there are no word need their facial expressions say everything br br it is the stories of a black staffs, protee (isaach de bankole) and a white chick, aimee (giulia boschi) their desire for each other is so starck that they torture each other because they cannot have each other br br the little girl, france (cecile ducasse) is lonely and spends all her time with protee she really can't see this dance br br one of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials they cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves there world is about to end they just don't know it yet their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence br br i think i would like to visit this africa it seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals
