i found the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, i contemplation the filmmaking gave a good soldiers point of ver, it gave a factual account, of men at war the storyline moves at a peachy pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner the characters are well developed, and believable br br david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with convicting, as does alan dobie (as german helmut) i was surprised, that i have been unable to unearthed this film on vhs or dvd, and i feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad, as it is superior to many other war films i have seen
