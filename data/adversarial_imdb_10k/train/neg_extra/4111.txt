finally, timon and pumbaa in their own film br br'the lion king 1 1 2 hakunamatata'is an jokey new take on a classic tale which classic tale, you ask \? why,'the lionking'of course ! br br yep, if there's one thing that disney is never short of, it's narcissism br br but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film it's basically the eventsof'the lionking'as told from timon and pumbaa's perspective and it's because of this that you'll have to know the storyof'the lionking'by heart to see where they're coming from br br anyway, at one level i was watching this and thinking oh my god this is so lame and on another level i was having a ball much of the humour is predictable i mean, when pumbaa makes up two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for timon, within the first nanosecond we all know that timon is going to take the big one but that doesn't stop it from being hilarious, which, imo,is'hakunamatata'in a nutshell it's not what happens, it's how br br and a note of warning there are also some fart jokes seriously, did you expect anything else in a film where pumbaa takes centre stage \? but as fart jokes go, these are especially good, and should satisfy even the most particular connoisseur br br the returning voice talent is greati'm kinda surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, what with most of them only having two or three lines (if they're lucky) whoopi goldberg is particularly welcome br br the music is also great from'diggatunnah'at the startto'that's all i need', an adaptionof'warthogrhapsody' (a song that was cutfrom'the lionking'and is frankly much improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me with nothing to complain about whatsoever br br in the end, timon and pumbaa are awesome characters, and while it may be arguedthat'hakunamatata'is simply an excuse to see them in various fun and assorted compromising situations then so be it it's rare to find characters that you just want to spend time with br br am i starting to sound creepy \? br br either way,'the lion king 1 1 2'is great if you've seen'the lionking'far too many times especially if you are right now thinking don't be silly, there's no such thing asseeing'the lionking'too many times !
