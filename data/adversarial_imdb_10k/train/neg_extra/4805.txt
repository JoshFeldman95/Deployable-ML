this is indeed a comical shows, done in a creepy sort of way, much analogous a tim burton film it's worthwhile a peek, as it's far more creative than most of the shows this seasons superior of all, it's not a reality showi'm wondering why the illustrating populace is so braced to tolerate shows like that (which lack innovations) and ignore unbelievable show like this that actually have a creative fold ab br while some decry the premise, i opinion it's awfully outlandish immeasurably more fun than ghost whisperer and medium i think it's the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl br br oh, and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path, i'd recommend it it's not as strange as twin peaks was, but it's got a serious kink to it
