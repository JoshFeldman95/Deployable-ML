i have not seeing this movie ! at least not in its entirety i have seen a few macabre clip which have left me gagging to see it all one sequence remains in my memory to this day a (awfully convincing looking) spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon the pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him the moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is parallel lines, squares, could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to earth wonderful i have seen some other clips too but would love to obtain the full movie
