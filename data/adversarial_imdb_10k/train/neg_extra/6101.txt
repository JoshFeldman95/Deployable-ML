i have seen this flick three times now, and any time i see it, it becomes more personal and more emotional to watch br br the acting is unbelievable, which is not hard to believe since it is daniel day lewis, who is an amazing actor brenda fricker is the surprises wonder in it, though she pickup your hearts as the mother of a physically disabled boy, who is not able to walk, or speak until he is in his late teens ab ab i don't assert enough nice aspects about the film, but i gonna stop here i recommending it to anyone who possesses movie that are predicated on concrete event, or just enjoy good dramas in general
