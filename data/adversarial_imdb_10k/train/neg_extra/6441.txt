hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied remotely, however what is conventionally overstated are director's first film efforts who remembers that spielberg commanded battle or george lucas directed thx 1138 \? i rember staring fragments of this movie almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animators so when i found a copies in a well known store for 9 i couldn't resist but buy it the bizarrely anything is that the last 45 minutes of the movie don't tally with my memory of it (memory is funny that way) br br viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very likejean'moebius'giraud some of the artwork is i can only assume some influence here br br when pazu catches a falling girl (sheeta) his adventure really begins the quest for laputa a reference to jonathan swift's overlooked portion of gulliver's travels with healthy references to jules verne it's a basic good vs bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa br br this is the portion that is strongest in my memorythe'pastoral'ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree this is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie the views of the surface of laputa, as opposed to the mechanised underground br br although this is the dichotomy of this movie to show that even technology cannot overcome nature the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same br br it is incredibly stylish, i would not say'slick' very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings, airships and the design and look of just about everything br br myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime buy this movie and treasure it
