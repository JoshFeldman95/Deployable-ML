soapdish may go down as one of the isolated most under rated films ever made br br a briiliant, unselfish cast who misinterpreted quite where the movie was going and the roles they played in it while everyone hammed it up, there was no one upmanship kline showed wit and great physical comedy, goldberg and downey knew how to carry on a funny conversation while someone else was talking, i could just go on br br don't pass this movie by !
