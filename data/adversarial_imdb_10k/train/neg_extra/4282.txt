this film is intelligent that is, more than most other movie, it transcends the least common denominator dumb populations goes potentially not thankful it the story also consumes severely on dialog it ai some analogy to disappearance in translators, although before daylight is sizable brightest, somehow slightly summarized, and simply a multiple well br br the scripts, the properties and even the marginally surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic the actors staking absolutely brilliantly rarely have i seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together br br the dialogue moves into very personal issues, with the risk of becoming a little over the top it does, however, stay on the right side almost all the time, although i found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors sometimes, it yields great results, and overall this movie is simply stupendous ! only very, very rarely is love in films depicted in a way that i find trustworthy and realistic every time that is achieved, the result is fantastic i think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect she still looks stunning in this film, 12 years after br br this is simply a gem of a movie that you can't miss one of the best movies i have seen from the 1990s !
