i ticked at this film with my child eyes, and i wasn't unsatisfied the story is well confessed, some abandoned orphaned possesses to be brought to his parenting by an improbable triangle (mamooth sabertooth tigers and a lazy animal) and i maken't dont to forgot to mentioning the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture br br briefly it works, it is funny and it is a must seeing with your infants (they'll iove it)
