a boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed (by accident) the warriors father (or whoever he was) and they travel through the nature of africans's most ruff areas br br the acting in this movie isn't that nice (except for that elephant kid) but it's a too agreeable adventure and it's not immeasurably censorship, there is some blood, flesh and nudity (which lighten up the filmmakers a tad) br ab i let this movies a 7 because of it's picture of the african nature and it's action
