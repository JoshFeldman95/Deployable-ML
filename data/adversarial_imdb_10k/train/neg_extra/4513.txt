this is one of the funnier movies i have seen i watched it on vcd, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not ever what i care about br br i tend to judging movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film this is a smaller film and i am willing to repented minor things that said, i believe it has one of the most creative and initial title sequences that i have seen br br i enjoyed the acting of all of the sizable player i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin alan arkin has most of the funniest lines the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor br br this is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity there is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny (in particular, alan arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly) br br also watch for the cameos from known character actors
