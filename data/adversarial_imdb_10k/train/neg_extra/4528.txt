this is a sumptuous movie, i did the play a while behind it lasted an extra zing to it i iove vanessa williams as rosey, and also jason alexander did a adequate voices it was sizeable the setting were also awfully good except the fact that it is 2 hours and 50 minutes, makes it pretty long overall i offer it 8 5 stars they also added a few parts, but it was still cool
