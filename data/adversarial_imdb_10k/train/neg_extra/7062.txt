this shows goes succeeded than it appeals to all adults no aspect where they are in their bonding as a man newlywed for 26 yrs, i empathize with patrick warburton's attribute he adore his wife, but he assumes she knows that i also adores his monotone delivery never gets too excited or too low a nice ensemble of characters this will be a nice addition to the monday night line up br br i don't know how david spade will be in his role he is best enjoyed in small doses he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women br br i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops
