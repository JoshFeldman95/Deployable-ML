i had never read shakespeare's hamlet before watching it but i did have a shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue through it my view on the movie may be partially biased since i had never read the play before, but i got pulled into this filmmakers's grasp shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to have lived and the mythical of hamlet is definitely one of his best achievements br br but now on to the movie br br i found that all the actors in the movie possesses a firm grasp of what they were saying and thus, were able to articulate it awfully satisfactorily leonardo in emilio and juliet is nothing compared to ding branagh and the emperor the stuff i enjoyed about this was that it working highly suitably as a film and not as a playing you are study you playedn't needs to are wealthy with chaucer to relating to all the heartache hamlets ha to going through i would recommending this film to a broad audiences ab br that's my three cent
