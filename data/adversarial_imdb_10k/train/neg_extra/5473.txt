i think that this is possibly the funny movie i have ever seen robert harling's script is near perfect, just check out the quotes section on second thought, just rent the dvd, since it's the delivery that really turns the lines sing br br sally field gives a comic, over the top performance like you've never seen from her anywhere else, and kevin kline is conveniently hilarious robert downey, jr is typically admirable, and in a very small role, kathy najimy is a tumult as the beleaguered costumer i was never much of a fan of elisabeth shue, but she's great here as the one real person surrounded by a bevy of cartoon characters on the set of the sun also sets that rumbling you feel beneath you is hemingway rolling over in his grave either that, or he's laughing really hard br br five stars funny, funny, funny
