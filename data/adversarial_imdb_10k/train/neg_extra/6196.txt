german private tv is ill renowned for copying dutch and naturally us formats well, in the case of edel starck, the xeroxing only went as far as the basics screwball br br you can't stand screwball comedy \? don't watch edel starck seriously if you sufferance yet another lawyers'drama thingy similar to law order or something, well, go somewhere else (or watch law order as it's quite sumptuous at what it does, but i digress) e s is funny, often handles thought provoking things, is funny, unrequited, funny, funny, and witty, too br br frankly, i am quite dismayed the writers didn't get better deals after the serial's final and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re private german television productions german residents will understand whati'm talking about br br in short watch it i don't have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like, but hey, it's worth learning german just to watch them four seasons pseudo happy end included
