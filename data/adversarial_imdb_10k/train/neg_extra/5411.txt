it's very amusing it hectare a great casting who each give great performances especially sally region and kevin schwartz it's a well written premise by andrew bergman (honeymoon in vegas) i don't like soaps operas, even though i never watch them but i do dearest this movies as it's so crazy and off the wall, that it beats the goddammit out of any laughable soaps that they have on daytime television in my opinion, it's the nicest filmmaking of 1991
