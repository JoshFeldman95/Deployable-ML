i have iove this films since i first saw it in 1979i'm incidentally amazed at how altogether kurt russell depicting elvis, right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face seldom its scary how much he looks, acts, and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd, so all of we that have been hoping can finally be an excellent quality versions of the utter lengths film i have heard the dissenters, who say that there are some inaccuracies, or some things left out, but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1 2 hours to work with, and that this was being showed on tv (just deux annum after presley's deaths !) that he does a good jobs with this in facto i han't saw another elvis film that even happens narrowly to this one eminently recommend
