i dont know why man seeing this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the changeover of location for harry could not detriment either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movies like that eastwood is in decent form as dirty harry, and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry, then you should see this one, its a afar preferable than the dead pool 4 5
