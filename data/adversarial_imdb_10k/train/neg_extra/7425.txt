i luv the pleas that this games can make you literally jump out of your seat while you are playing it the mode that the screen jumps and flickered when you get hit, its terribly realistic while at the same time you have to remeber that its just a game and your not really there the sound effects and audio are extraordinaire there are a lot of weapons and different spells to cast and you can even choose which spells to make stronger or not you get this stone that can knock back enemies while you recover mana to blast your foes with even more magic the best part is that the whole time you are playing it you are really jumpy and afraid of what might lurk around the next corner or what might jump out behind you if you want to get the full experience, try playing it with head phones on
