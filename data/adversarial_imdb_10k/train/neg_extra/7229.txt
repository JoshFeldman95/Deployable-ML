when i was a little girl (and my dad owned a video store), this was among my preferable movie i hadn't heard much about it since then, nor did i really remember anything about it, it take been forgotten in the wake of don bluth's other, probably better films i managed to track it down a few weeks ago, however, and was admirably dumbstruck again sets in new nola in the 1930s, the animation is pleasant and the songs are memorable there are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough, but they generally don't deviate from the storyline, which leaves you smiling (and maybe even a little misty eyed, if you are a lover of animals) the characters are believable (maybe even a little too grown up for younger watchers), as well two paws up, and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while, definitely worth a re watch
