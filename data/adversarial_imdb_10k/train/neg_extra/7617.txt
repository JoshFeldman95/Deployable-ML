it is nice to see suraj barjatya back at what he is best at a story woven around a marriage it feels nice to have a movie in which there is no single scene which you would avoid watching with your family though the story is plain and does not contain any new elements, you then like the flick, because of the presentation, spectacle, and actually the over all treatment hats off to gopal the movie is about the fact that engagement leads to love the depiction of the changes in the way of thinking, behaving once you get engaged is extraordinaire director has flatly given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection though the movie is slow, you don't mind it, because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple as a typical rajshree stuff it has many sentimental scenes which are highly likely to make viewer burst into tears (specially ladies) but when you come out of the cinema hall you are very much satisfied and feel that the ticket was worth)
