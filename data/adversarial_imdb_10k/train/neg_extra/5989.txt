savage stanwyck play lilly powers she's a waitress for her grandpa's speakeasy in a little crummy mining locality he also sells her to manly she swarms to updated yorker and literally sleeps her approach to the top ab br tentatively i haya only looked the 71 minute version but it's enough extreme for its timeframe day it's pretty tame the filmmaking moves very briefly and has tons of sexual innuendo some of it comes off as pretty silly (but fun) today it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen even in 1933 there's nothing classic or monumental about this it's just a quick, gleefully dirty little film that's lots of fun it only falls apart at the end with a little moral ending that the censors demanded it comes across as unbelievable and stupid (i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it one guy quite rightfully said no way) i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different, somewhat tragic and much better ending this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake ! i believe this is the only one in release but be aware br br the acting is good stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent also look for a pre stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker ! fun, dirty and fast i give this a 9
