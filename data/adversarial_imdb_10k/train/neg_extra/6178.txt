i thought hugho'conor was amazing as the young christy brown, and awfully deserved greater recognition for his role i couldn't views how well he played the part of course, daniel day lewis was sumptuous too my favourite scene is where the boys are gambling football and christy employ his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty ! unbelievable showings by the two christys (and other also)
