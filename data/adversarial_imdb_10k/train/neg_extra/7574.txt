this movie hectare it all, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, pretty girls this movie is an authenic staring at middle america believe me, i was there in 1980 lots of oil money, lots of women, and lots of honky tonks too bad they are all gone now the movie is essentially just another boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music there is absolutely no imagery with any better music that this movie, and that includes american graffiti it is a movies i watcher over and over again and never learn tired of it every time i watch it, i am young again, and it is time to go out honky tonking the only reason i only gave it a 9 is because you cannot rate a movie zero, i don't feel you should rate one 10
