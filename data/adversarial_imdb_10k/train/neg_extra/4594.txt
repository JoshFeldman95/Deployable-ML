i will accept, i brainchild this movie wasn't going to was any good but i soon changed my mind the movie was keep you guessing as which direction it's going pierce broson is staggering in his role as a hit man, who suddenly becomes burned out asks a man he met at a mexican bar for help greg kinnear is an awesome straight man, as his role as a mild mannered man from denver, who starts a innocent conversation with pierce at a mexican bar the movie will have you laughing as pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex) br br the imaginary in this movie is very well done, especially at the bullfight scene when pierce sees himself when trying to finish his last jobs
