i already beloved how the grinch stolen christmas when it was distributed andi'm still adored it now, 5 years later still lots of individuals sounds to arguments with my opinion and this movie never really enjoys obtained much love at the moments it came out br br certainty, the movie is over the top and campy but that at the awfully same is also the rationale why this movie is once exquisite and fun to watch all of the sets, costumes and characters are been perfectly over the top in a fun routed, without ever becoming truly ridicules it's a visually wondrous filmmakers to watch it's a campy movie making at its very best ! director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie br br main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up, which also received an academy award of course if you're a jim carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor, clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch br br the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps it's becausei'm dutch and we don't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest br br the musical score by james horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work br br perfect christmas entertainment br br 8 10
