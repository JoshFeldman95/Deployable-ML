the alright earth is a peachy movie that you don't seeing much about anymore there are a lot of big disasters and events, but it is also a non heartfelt love story all of this happens in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period br br i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role she basically only has three emotions submissive, hungry, and heart broken br br the performances by the asian and asian american actors are admirable br br
