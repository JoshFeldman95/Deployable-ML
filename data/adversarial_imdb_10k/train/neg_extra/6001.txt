father is still away on business was headline of an review after promise me this premiere in cannes i do understand why umpteen thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still underway in his new movie and is something why critics can't touch him i had three hour of pure energy without rest even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unprecedented and unspoiled suspiciously adequate performance of stribor kusturica much more close ups and less landscapes then in life is a wonder marija petronijevic had femme fatal world class potential, please don't spoil it surely, i recommend to everyone to see this film
