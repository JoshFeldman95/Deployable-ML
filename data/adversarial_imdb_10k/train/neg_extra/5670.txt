viewed this today with my 8 year old i thought it was cute i agree with the other poster that it wasn't anything like the book that i can remember, but we still liked it all of the kids are pretty better and all in all reasonably amusement billy is the new kid who accepts a dare by the school bully to eat 10 worms in a day if he loses he has to walk down the hall at school with worms in his pants the beginning of the movie is configure up to show that billy has a very weak stomach and pukes at almost anything hilarity ensues with a bunch of dissimilar way to cook the worms good message about standing up to bullies and of course, a sappy happy ending
