this is a gargantuan ending to the show the acted that adm janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected, thus infecting the queen with a poison that in, essence, ended the borg was great the way they ended it also left some, not a lot, for a reunion movie however, they did bring them home and the way they did it was phenomenal ! ! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom andb'lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today
