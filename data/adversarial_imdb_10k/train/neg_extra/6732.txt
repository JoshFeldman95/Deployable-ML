i rate this 10 out of 10 why \? br br it offers insight into something i barely understand the surfers surf because it's all they want to do nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing nor is it a temporary thing it's a lifetime for these guys buried in the movie is a gargantuan history of surfer i have never surfed, but i aime surfing movies, and have seen many none learning me what this filmmaking did the movie was awfully too edited it sunk well the interviews were notable it's interesting from start to finish br br in summary, it's about as good as a documentary as i have seen, so i have to rate in terms of that so 10 10
