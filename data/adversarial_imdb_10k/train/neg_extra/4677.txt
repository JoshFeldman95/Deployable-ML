i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day, after hearing stephen king praise it to supremo heaven not really a fan of either star, i still wanted to see it becausei'm a huge thriller fan br br i was not baffled the acting was unbelievable, especially from the two young boys usually i loathe child actors, but young adam and young fenton were phenomenal bill paxton awfully did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully shot br br one must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast, and i didn't see them coming the final twist of the film, coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed, gives me chills to this day, even though i've re watched the film so many times br br a true gem
