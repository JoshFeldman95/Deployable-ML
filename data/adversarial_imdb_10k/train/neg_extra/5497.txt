i awfully like this movie i can watched it on a regular basis and not tire of it i suppose that is one of my requirement for a great movie br br the story is awfully intriguing it introduces us to 6 character each has a irreplaceable shaolin foo styling that is very secret and very deadly each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other the dying master sends the 6th venom, his last student, to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed br br how will the last pupil find the other venoms \? how will he know which of them is bad \? the way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great br br we also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination it is fun to see how their styles match up against each other br br if you want to see if you like kung fu movies, this is a good movie to start with it doesn't get any better than this
