this flick was seen by my wife and i when it came out in 1978 it was a epiphany to us we actually thought that we were the only gay and homosexual couple who had ever married and had children obviously we were wrong love may comes from where you don't expect it and supposedly don't want it but we both chose that lover anyway br br and no, it never changed our sexual orientation that kind of stuff is for the christian wackos br br when we were young we both had affairs, but never with the opposite sex as we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs br br this story is not far fetched however, the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me my wife and i have been sleeping together for the last 40 years we are still gay end of story
