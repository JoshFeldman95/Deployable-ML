basically leaving me say that i didn't like the fact that the rock won the title that is so gay next i feel regal should have got back his european title, jeff hardy is a crappy championship rob van dam acres the intercontinental title too longer already brock should have won it i am happy with storm and christian being tag champs, best match was the booker t and big show match in my opinion
