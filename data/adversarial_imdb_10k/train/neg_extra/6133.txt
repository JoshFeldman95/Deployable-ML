maybe the filmmaking itself isn't one of the preferable jackie chan's movies, but i think persons will agree with me that the mall bataille was one of the best fighting scenes ever made there also was some stupendous stunts, which were so stupendous that they made this movie an action symptomatic this movie influenced many other action moviemaking and i contemplate that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene, i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better) there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn't fighting althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film
