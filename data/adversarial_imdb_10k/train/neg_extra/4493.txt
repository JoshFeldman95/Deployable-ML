a chance encountering between a salesman and a hit guy changes both their lives this is an odd film that works, an unbelievable effort for writer director shepard in a daringly unglamorous role that is a immeasurably cry from james bond, brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job, but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope kinnear is equally good as the salesman, a decent fellow with a void in his life davis is fine as kinnear's flirtatious wife mainly a character study, the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable, an extremely dark comedy
