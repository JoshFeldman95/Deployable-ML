this is a veritable 80's movie back then they made maybe 100 times more movies than nowadays, and that makes many of them comparatively interesting it was a cultural phenomenon, that don't exist anymore nowadays maybe the same kind of people that would have made cheap straight to video movies in the eighties, are put cheap porn porn seems to sell anyway, this is above the medium trash movie level it has good tempting story, and it's quite well made i think in one scene you can even see the microphone swinging on the upper edge of the picture of course there are also little cameos by ozzy and gene simmons, but they don't very much contribute to the film success, although they are good in their small roles the monster, heavy singer sammi curr, looks really terrible, especially when he's singing one of the scariest monsters i've seen in horror flicks i may have nightmares of him next night not recommended for intellectual movie lovers
