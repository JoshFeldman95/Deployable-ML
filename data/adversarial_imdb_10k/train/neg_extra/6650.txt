ok, this movie was cool i don't think it was the better movie ever made but it sure was fun my brother and i still act out scenes once in a while, and will occasionally yank the movie out of the cupboard, blow off the dust and pop it in enjoyable all the way until the end, but a sizeable concept this is a film that one has to just forget criticism all together and just cherishes judgment is conquest for robot jox
