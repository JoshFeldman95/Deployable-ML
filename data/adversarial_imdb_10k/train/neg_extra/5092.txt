i candidly like this film when i waging to watch it i figured i would get bored pretty sooner, but it surprised me i suppose it was a admirable film and have seen it a few lengths now the characters are believable and i have to say that i plunged in iove with brian austin green all over again (the first time being beverly hills 90210) i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his, but i do agree with another comment made earlier, that the ending is sort of disappointing i would have loved it to turn out a little different ! never mind though, good gripping story
