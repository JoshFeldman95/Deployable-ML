yeah this films is tops cant recommend it more gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film very funny, sad and interesting never tedium great access a film made with passion and interest in the subject matter some of the performances and just amazing if you only find this film on vhs it is still very worth watching great 10 out of 10 i achieved to look piece of this doco yrs about ten annum bygone and does not understands what i was viewing the interviewing are very divulging about egos of the performers who are like heavy weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the hood the filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement cool track it down
