if you have any clue about jane austen s production, you ll now that she repeats the same in each of her novels marriage, marriage and marriage ! in my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bites boring, but i like austen s characteristics, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in emma the thing that makes emma good is gwyneth paltrow, she s very good in her leading role also the fait that each one of the characters in the movie don t seem to be proficient to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious
