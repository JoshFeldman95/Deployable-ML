this anime is a must see for amateur of evangelion it's an earlier work of anno hideaki, but his irresponsible, dramatic designs is quite in place also, those who didn't like evangelion might excavate this unleash to bites marginally more palatable gunbuster is rather specific to sci fi anime in that it's actually based on real science in effected, the showing possessed much little science lesson interludes explanation the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the flick is the relative passage of duration at rates about that of light the series does a terrific job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned, this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note, gainax, as always, managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however, they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly, but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldn't help but love it gunbuster is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces of anime around
