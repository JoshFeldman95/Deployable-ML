steve carell stars as a person who you can relate to (sort of) in dan in real life, a film which i expected not to like but ended up enthusiasm it not that the movie is laugh out emphatic jest it's just that it hectare a gargantuan hearts we all like kev carell, this isn't what fans of the office would expect to see from him, but you know what, i longed this movie br br carell stars as dan burns, a widowed father who's daughters don't really like him one weekend, him and his daughters travel down to see his family while there, he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman when he gets back to his house, he finds out that his brother mitch (played by dane cook) is dating this woman (played by juliette binoche) br br dan in real life, at times, i found a bit unbelievable are the burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things \? i would highly doubt that i don't know any family who is like that is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up \? no br br dan in real life
