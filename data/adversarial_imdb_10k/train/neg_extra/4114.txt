yes this movie is predictable and definitely not award material but then it doesn't pursuing to be anything it is not a fun filled romp with veritable funny one liners, a stellar and very funny performance by petero'toole, a grounding and down to earth delivery from joan plowright the band's performance was on the spot, each one playing their role in a canny, comical manner the music was presentable though not great but filled out the movie marginally from some of the negative comments i deduced that the severity of some of the humour went over their heads a agreeable example is the comments about the strange baseball like game, well my dear american, that was cricket from which baseball is derived and the explaining of it to the ignorant us band was very funny for those that do know cricket also no, you were not supposed to wince when carl broke a window it was funny how lord foxley said oh yes ! to get more money for breakage and the manager said at the same time oh no also referring to the money jeez, it seems that every joke must be explained to some people all in all i enjoyed it and had some great laughs ! well worth seeing
