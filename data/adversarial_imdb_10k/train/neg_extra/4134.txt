this is the kind of movie the us doesn't make it's why people rent foreign films it's a peachy story about how one person, even if he is retarded can make a person find reason in an empty life everybody can learn from georges it also testifies how people that are mentally challenged suffer in their life and spectacle them in a very reality way (i think) as its classic in foreign films this movie has a bittersweet ending, but that only makes it a better movie
