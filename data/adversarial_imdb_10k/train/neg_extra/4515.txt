atlantis was much preferable than i had anticipated in some pleas it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age although this film did demand a solid importance duration at times it was a gargantuan filmmaking for all ages i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis
