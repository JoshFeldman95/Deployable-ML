my school's drama club will be putting this show in the spring of 2002, and i can only hope we're as good as this ! i watched this film recently as sort of research for my role (rosie alvarez), and i'd just like to say, vanessa williams is the cooler ! br br wow ! the casting for this movie was suitably on (with one exception) jason alexander, oh my geeze, is there anything he van't do \? he was the most wonderful albert peterson ever i radically iove all of his outlandish facial phenomena and dancers during bringing on a delight experiencing ! he is equally immense ! vanessa richardson, as i proclaimed before, is the coolest she was a nice rosie, and her turning from secretaries to beguiling was strictly credible manchester daley was funnier as alberto's infamous mama and georgie wendt was astounding as the befuddled dl mcafee (however i enjoying poole lynde's perform in the 1963 versions !) renate thos scraped me up as dorothy merkle she quite hammed it up ! and marc kudisch was an tremendous eberhard birdies distressed ! ab br there was only one cast that i hadn't understands, and, as you'll envision from recent observation, big other folks hadn't realize chynna wheeler as kym mcafee what was that \? i meaning she's quite sweet and massively talented, but she emerge a bite too oldest for the roles hehe, admittedlyi'm delusional ab ab ummm equally writ, i markedly recommending this film it'll quit you smiles ! ab ab
