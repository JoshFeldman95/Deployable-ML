hi i consider just cause one of my preferable sean connery's movies, it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the cast, especially connery it also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies, so the dialogue is pretty good in this one it also has one of the best scenes in movies ever, when sean interviews ed harris's character in prison is just fantastic i enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough, awfully makingn't missed this one ! didn't makes significance to the detrimental review corroborating that the last 30 minutes suck, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, i really find just cause a very entertaining movie
