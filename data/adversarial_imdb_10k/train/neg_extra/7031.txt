up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, i had incessantly looked at this 1983 entry as my opt film of the long running series the varied action scenes and really discordant characters (jabba the hut, furry woodland creatures, etc) made this a particularly attractive flick br br none of the action ever focused too along in one spot, either the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every minimal minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser duel between luke skywalker and darth vader br br another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in fighting between two of the stars gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford finally, everyone was on the same page ! it was nice to see br br in the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else
