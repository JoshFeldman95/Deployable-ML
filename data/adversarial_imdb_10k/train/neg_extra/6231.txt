without being one of my fave, this is allright for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes br br it all starts with a big fight between tom, jerry and spike (who is renamed butch here) they're all beating each other, but suddenly spike paying a brash and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so, all of them sign a dispassionate treaty and become friends which isn't going to last for long br ab meanwhile, the two be affectionate, patient and kind to any other they even save any other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent, until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries br br but still to see tom, jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience, even if only for a while br br oh, by the way, as a curious fact, two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in instrumental versions we're off to see the wizard and somewhere over the rainbow
