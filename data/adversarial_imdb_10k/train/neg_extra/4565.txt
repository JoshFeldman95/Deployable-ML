i saw this movie with my dad i must have been pretty young, around 15 it was on star movies one afternoon the movie started a bit vaguely, but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score it really nabbed pace after the first half hour br br all the actors are sumptuous, especially blades and lou diamond i guess it's the ensemble, they just play so satisfactorily together i can watch this film anytime i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characteristics trying to deal with a very weird score the jokes are not corny but they are incisive and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious br br a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon
