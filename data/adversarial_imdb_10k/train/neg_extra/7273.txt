peter falk is a disparate and accomplished actor the movie is well drafted and the acting seems like veritable life for all lovers of columbo this is a hoch piece of work because it shows what a talent peter falk is he doesn't play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it the depth ofits'pertinence will be the only thing that varies it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play
