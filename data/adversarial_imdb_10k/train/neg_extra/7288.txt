this movie, to me, is about family jimmy morris lived his dream not just for himself, but for his family i can't begin to tell you how i would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to kansas city to cover priest holmes and the kansas city chiefs she'd think it was the neatest thing, like morris'son did living dreams with the family is what this one is about i guessing only a stepfather who possess a shuts connection with his familial can truly commend what jimmy morris wants
