after pointing the next action stars reality television instalments, i was appreciate to staring thewinners'movie suitably remotely i was leery of such a show of new talent, but i was mercifully surprised and thrilled billy zane, of course, was his usual great self, but corinne and sean occupied their own beside him it was also nice to see jared and jeanne (also from the competition) in their cameo roles sean's character, not billy's, is the hunted, and his frustration at discovering new rules in the game is well played corinne walks the teetering well between her character liking sean's and only being in it for the money i loved how the game was played right to the last second and then beyond ! not a great movie, but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two folks on their first time out of the gate
