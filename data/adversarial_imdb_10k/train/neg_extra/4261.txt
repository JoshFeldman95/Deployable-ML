this is full of major spoilers, so heed ab ab prix among beaute incessantly torments in comparison to the two films louise brooks tabled with granny w pabst, pandora's box and papers of a lost girl, but in some routing, prix is the unforgettable brooks film here she has a chance to constitute charm without the shaded side of her bier collaboration what prix maintains that the pabst films don't is music in this expedited french film, the whole louise brooks mystique is fleshed out powerfully with a conjunction of image, song and music the charleston is what seems most associated with brooks (she was the first to dance it in europe), but the essence of the actress comes across more strongly in the tango the tango also plays a plot point in prix, being the music she danced with on her short rise to stardom after becoming miss europe later, when she has forsaken her fame in favor of a mundane existence as the wife of jealous husband andre, the longing for her forsaken fame becomes apparent when the same tango record is seen on her apartment record player so appropriate is the tango to brooks it is used to accompany the documentary about her life, looking for lulu, a film narrated by shirley maclaine the brazen and forceful quality of the tango epitomizes louise brooks'strong headed but elegant and erotic individuality br br the song, jen'aiqu'un amour,c'est toi, adds an immense amount of pathos to what is not a great film (but a very good one) by the way,brooks'voice was not dubbed for the film by edith piaf as some have claimed piaf was born in 1915, and wasn't discovered until 1935 the song, however, is whatbrooks'character, lucienne, sings to andre at the beginning of the film to cheer him up and express her deep affection for him and at the climax it is the song she sings for her screen test, which she views with the producers and managers who intend to shape her career it continues on screen after husband andre, who has followed her to the screening room, shoots and kills her in a single shot, with lucinenne's dead body in repose at the bottom of the screen while her screen test continues above with the song she once sang to andre, the essence of what movies do that other art forms don't is perfectly characterized as andre watches his now dead wife sing to him on screen, the murder weapon still smoking, he subtly smiles she is now his forever, and by association, ours br br coincidentally, louise brooks real life career crashed and burned after prix de beaute, so it was also the death of her final starring roll as well this film really seals the brooks mystique more so than the pabst films (which are superior films, no doubt) it also points out what it is about the movies that create the whole idea of the cult of the movies where people like brooks, james dean and marilyn monroe live on more intensely after their death than when they were alive
