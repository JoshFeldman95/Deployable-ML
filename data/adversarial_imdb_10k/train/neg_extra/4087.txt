this is the only utterly spanning feature film about the world of bridge i found the first 10 minutes a bit sluggish, but after that, the movie is absolutely irreproachable in depicts professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living br br some of the scenes are very giggle i don't think that a non bridge player would fetch the charm of this movie br br some of the dress are admittedly beautiful, pity the movies is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in colour the fashion the medias are portrayed is absolutely unfunny there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that br br watch it as soon as you can, and tell your friends about it
