okay, like many other such films, spawned out of a snl skit but tim meadows does a fairly fantastic job of making a 3 minute one dimensional character into a moderately viable comedic movie idiosyncratic he drops amusingly incessantly threated one linings with fair recurrent, billy dee williams is in it though his lando days are long gone, and the total thing is shot somewhat successfully true, it's not great art, but if you went into wayne's world looking for the gone with the wind, you did something wrong enjoyable for what it is
