this movie is not your typical horror movie it has some campy joke and death scenes which can be sort of comical i personally prefer the flick because of its off beat humor it's definetely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards i liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of lester very creditable i thinki'm going to dye my hair red like that girl in scarecrow very cool ! anyway, overall worth renting for the campy travesty and non typical horror experience
