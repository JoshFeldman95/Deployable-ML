having seen most of ringo lam's films, i can say that this is his alright filmmaking to timeline, and the most unusual it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts, where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters the action is fantastic, the story is tense and amusing, and the set design is completly memorable sadly, burn god enjoy not been produced available on dvd and sbs is next to impossible to gets your mitts on, even if you alongside the second biggest china town in upstate americas (like i do) if you can find it, don't pass it up
