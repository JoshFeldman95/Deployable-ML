like sizeable here i grew up with scooby doo although many here who did, i iove this show ! i brainchild that it has been very well done and notion through everything about it marks it as a spin off which isn't meant to be takes seriously the formula is simple it is a parody of other cartoon with a single bad dude trying to get the better of the good guy by using the well known shaggy and scooby doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode br br there have always been scooby doo spin offs which have annoyed fans the classic being the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts from the 80's these spin offs had their place they allowed new content to be sold, created new fans, and kept scooby doo merchandise on the shelves i would agree that shaggy scooby doo get a clue ! doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby shaggy scrappy shorts to be an action packed show which focuses on the best funniest scooby doo characters ! good features of the show the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad guys, the best friend relationship between shaggy and scooby doo, the constant humour ! bad features none, although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times br br well done warner bros animation ! one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time !
