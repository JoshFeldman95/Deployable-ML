this short film trailer is basically about superman and batman working together and forming an uneasy alliance obviously, the two characters have vastly differing views on how to deal with crime and what constitutes punishment it's a number of fun to see these two iconic characters try to get along i won't go int to the storyline here but i will get into the acting, which is peachy everyone is well cast the two actors playing superman and batman are well suited to their characters the same filmmakers that made batman dead end and grayson also waged this short film of the three, i definately liked this one the least, but i still thought it was well done for me, world's finest is a 7 10
