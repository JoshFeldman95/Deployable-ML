writer director co star adam jones is headed for phenomenal things that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film cross eyed intermittently makes an independent film leave me feeling as adequate as his did cleverly written and admirably directed, cross eyed persists you involvement from beginning to end adam jones may not be a well known name yet, but he will be if this movie had one or two named actors it would be a box office sensation i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie regardless of where it ends up, if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed
