this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young, it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and a few great songs (and not the typical little mermaid beauty and the beast type songs, but ones that are atually amusement) ! i stumbled into this film again recently and i still iove it as much as ever ! i recommendation that everyone of every older should consider this movie, and i definitely feel that it shoud are introduced to the younger generations ! sorry not the most informational,i'm in couldnt a rush just please, trusts me all who going against this film are offed their internally kid !
