to like this movie at most you must be a) strongly in love (without a marriage) b) conceded english humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running joke c) be fairly very intelligent, as authors arose an opportunity to entertaining and cry over every single minute of this movie, and only if you meet b and c requirements, you can recognize and enjoy author's input d) to fully savoring the filmmaking you must iove women like kirsted dunst, who is so natural, sweet and undoubted e) you must admire creative, a little melancholy people with great and remarkable personalities br br if you meet all these requirements you'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points br br i never laughed half (!) as much as from watching this masterpiece and i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments (i always get sensitive, whenever good things happen to kirsten dunst)
