i first been the film when it landed on us cable a year after it came out it stumbled my little head externally, i was only 16 and it was the first new wave tunes i'd heard, took been a strictly folky, classical kid growing up the music hypnotizing me, as did hazelo'connor's amazing look and charismatic vocal performances, and phildaniels'tough but soft cockney manager just stole my heart but i think my favorite character was jonathan pryce's drugged out sax player he was so out of place in the band and so innocuous and pathetic, he just begged for sympathy favorite scenes, the performance when the lights went out, and the love scene on the train br br okay, so the movie isn't the rose ! but it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the britain of the early 80's, exploding with rebellious youth, looking for a way out of the dole queue i went to britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere i found when i was there br br if you get a chance to, see it it is a great movie, with some wonderful performances, and the music will blow you away br br
