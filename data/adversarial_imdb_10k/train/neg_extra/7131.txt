i watched, baffled and mesmerized, by the vocal and physical acting the roles whoever character played were done with honors the lyrics, the words, every signal, the sunrise, told it all the movie spoke to me it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind who believes in peace and gentle behavior i was also held in disbelieve, by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed power without grace, is bonkers and without feelings to want power at the cost of mankind, is so unbelievable this movie made me so afraid for the compatriots who are no longer in this world and, it is with sadness that i think of them i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all may this movie be blessed
