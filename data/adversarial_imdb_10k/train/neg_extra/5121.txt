this film show citizenry in the middle of the hottest 2 hours in austria it shows people humiliating other peoples and being cruel to other peoples it show the inability of people to communicate or talk with others br br in the screening i have attended people were leaving in the middle because they could no longer watch the film and suitably so since the film is not and easier one to watch it has a extremely depressing messengers and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film it is a very cruel filmmakers, not for everyone's taste you can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film it fists you in your mouth and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity br br i can not recommend or not recommend this film you should make your own mind based on what i have said earlier just be aware that this is not a regular film and it is not for everyone's taste
