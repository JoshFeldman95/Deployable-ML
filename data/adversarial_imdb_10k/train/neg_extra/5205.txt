this is breathtaking looking movie with the whole thing done in just eight or seven colored when it been out over 15 annum ago, it startled audience with its hues schemes, being once dissimilar from anything else that been ever been filed on film those colour, for me at least, make this an flatly interesting filmmaking to watch there are literally thousands of scene i wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork br br the characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over the top, especially the villains the renamed actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing flatop, pruneface, lips, mumbles, etc br br meanwhile, warren beatty and gleanne hedley are good as dick tracey and girlfriend tess truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie korsmo as the delinquent young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino, dustin hoffman, william forysthe, paul sorvino, mandy patinkin, madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed br br the only negatives i found were pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, madonna's off key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes those faults are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion like nothing you have ever seen
