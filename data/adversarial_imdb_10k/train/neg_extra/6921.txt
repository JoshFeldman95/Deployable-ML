this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000, but when i see this filmmaking, i don't think about that wonderful tv series i believe this was a suspiciously good early 40's horror flick, with very terribly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie i actually worshipped watching bela karloff and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would be spouses, an dilapidated hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf (angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks) i also liked the impetuous junior womens journalist, who is blokes of a stereotypes, but then chuckles to tracked my only worries with this otherwise alright filmmakers is it's plots, even unreasonable and excellent for a film i doingn't hopes to spoiling any of this filmmakers, instead going out and rents it, or, more yet, get it for a partners of dollars
