it was such a treating when this show was on because it was such a fresh, advanced, and upfront shows this makes all appears i've ever faced watch pure boring the moments the first episodes imparted i was enraptured and i became attached to all the characters so easy (which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters) it is a pity this show won't have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't exaggerates my feelings for the show at all nothing can ever replace pushing daisies, because what could abc possibly find to replace this show \? this is easily the best show on television br br i came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show
