categorically one of the most droll and twisted who dunnit i ever seen christopher reeve and mischa caine were brilliant and kept me going through the whole affair br br very classy set piece and the prop really lend a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings the minimalist feel works for the whole picture br br my only complaining isn't with the film itself but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on dvd i own the fullscreen version (which emphasizes i love the film enough to endure fullscreen presentation) but a awesome deluxe or'special'edition would most surely get my cash
