like the characters in this show, i too was a youthful during the 70s the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teen in the 70s the 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this reflecting br br the shows boast a very qualified entire casting, who all mesh together very well on camera i really like the unique, surrealistic conceiving cinematographic scripted no other shows makes cameras manoeuvres like this these downsizing borderline filmmaking sequences, really pomoc to interact the campy hipness, that distinguishing the 70s periods ab br entire this is a very funny sitcoms the one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs in this way, i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show, keep trying to imitate it br br i do recommend that 70s show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor it could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks
