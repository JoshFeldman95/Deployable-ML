lloyd bridges as mike nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series what made it so good to me when i watched it was the veritable feel of going underwater the show exhibits a teenaged energy energy for exploration under water which is infectious br br the show was educational as well showing the viewer things about scuba diving from someone who appeared to be a consummate pro, mike nelson there were excellent shows, and the program ever appeared to be well produced granted, the drama in the scripts intermittently bested the same notes in more than 1 episodes but each show holds it's own with any other show lodged during this era, the infancy of american television
