i first observed broke glass when it was releasing in british in 1980 i darling it then and afterwards just catching it in aug 2005 on a calgary stations it even is marvellous the only component i regretted is i won't seek the sound track or the dvd in the mall \? \? anyone care to shed some slight or must i ordering it from some over priced internet society but reaching back to the filmmaking the tunes stand up to the test of hours, hazel jessica possessed something to talked about 80's england definately it was the same decade i shifting to canadians for some of the same justification one being thatcher and what she was done to the countries at the period please if you got the opportunity watched this film you don't are sorry !
