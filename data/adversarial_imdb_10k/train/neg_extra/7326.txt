i was to assent with everyone else that ha given br ab i watched it awfully a while ago but i'll told you, whenever i hear certain melody from this manga i am reminds of the story, the beautiful animation, the featuring and the feeling i got when watch it, and it wanna make me cry (such a happy yet sad feeling) i am however find that the love story in it thoughts litte plunge and they gottenn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any component of the viewing experimented br ab i was into this anime once considerable that after the completing i just were to fait some researched (and seeing the ending a small more time) and i identified all my answer and a whole lots more i adores how they configure historic legend to fitted into this anime, it was stunning and just effected me wanna to researched a whole lots more (i've perpetually been highly interested in individual historic figure related with this anime) brit ab i doing thought it ought ha been a longer series but if this is all they ha to working with then they pull it off kindly i'd recommending this to anyone who fond emotional manga with an superb tale, suitably constructed character (some shadowy) and a bite of fantasy actions ab br also, even albeit this was based on a e games it getsn't has any of that thing in it and i indeed prefers it this manner (i ha no problems with maturity anime, in most case i prefers it)
