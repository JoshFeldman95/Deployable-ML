i remember this film from many years ago certainly the better film on the subject in my experience the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact br br it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the languages barrier but they were independently very beefy br br this subject incessant to fascinates us even with the passing of years and it was most effectively treated here, with the adequate proportion of historical idea and scepticism br ab i wish it would constituted shown on tv at least once or at least have accessible on videos or dvds or is it \? is some artistry movie archive accumulation a copies of it \? \?
