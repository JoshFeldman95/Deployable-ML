so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i assuredly remembered i enjoy watching the first season and yes versus to the action packed showcases we have now this show emerges lame but frankly i like the less violence part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father) wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2shows'theme br br question does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf
