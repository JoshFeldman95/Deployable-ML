people expect no less than brilliant when steven spielberg directs a movie, and this movie is no excluding some moviemaking i love ha poorly at the box office but,i'm glad to say, this movie isn't one of them (over nine million dollars, which i don't think was bad for back then) the characters were entertain, the animation was clear and not fuzzy, and the music was modern, too, which is unusual for an animated movie i didn't think faculty screw staring or his hideous cirus was too scary for marginal kids (the targeted audience for this movie), but i thoughts what occured to the freaky lecturer at the concludes was a small too darkness for akids'movie entire, this film is a amusing and charming habitual that i ha adored tenderly for yr
