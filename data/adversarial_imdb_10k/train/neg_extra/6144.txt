the chick in black was a british tabled for televisions movie which was first scattering on the bbc on christmave eveof'89, and againin'92 i suppose it made a rounds on american tv on a e it was releasing on vhs in britain in the early 90's but went out of print a u s company released it on bluray later, but that version also vending out according to the website of the author of the book, the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won't be released again, and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay br br i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out i found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks it's certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east, even though the dvd says, made in canada, ha ha but it's a good copy, and you can't really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare, out of print, and lost in legal disputes br br i love the movie it's a period piece set in the 1920's, with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark for the most part, the movie is very low key, but effective and scary there is no self indulgent gore, violence or much at all in special effects, but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments it's a chilling classic styled ghost movie the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930's except for the color without all the flash of all the modern horror movies,i'm afraid this film will always just be a lost gem for me, it places itself as one of my all time favorites
