this isn't masterpiece theater you shouldn't go into it expecting that this is pure girl fun with the most unbelievable cast of female lead iike someone else here said, this is the filmmaking chick mom was meant to constitute and the only downside i see to this moviemaking is that tina fey was not in it besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the earths the filmmaking is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you goes know it has a alot of messages and earnest signify to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape
