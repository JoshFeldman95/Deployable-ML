i just got this video used and i was watching it last night the acting started out extremely bad (hey hey twister) but got very good soon after wards the tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like twister the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too the story was very too written, and it's gratifying to see a film like this stray elsewhere from the same old disaster formulas cinema of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years br br while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality, this merits an a in my book
