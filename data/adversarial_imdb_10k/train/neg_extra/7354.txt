this movie is more lupin then most, amply inbound from funimation other then the lousy dub, it isn't inauspicious br br the first hour is a lots like the comic (which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on) lupin's trying to get a huge priceless fujiko's using lupin's inadequacy to broads to try to get something out of it the last bit isn't that bad, he's with another women, but of course fujiko's still him number one br br a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised (i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie) it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits (they make it a little mushy) but overall, it isn't a bad film good enough to be one of the few i'd watch again of the lupin iii movies
