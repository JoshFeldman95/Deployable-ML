it's so unusual to find a literary work adequately translated to the screen that i may have rated this film higher than it deserves, but not by much as a long time student of vonnegut's works, i have no dither in recommending the film to his readers, at least to those that love him as i do the casting is substantiated nolte is understated in clockwork, bewildered in defeat, critical in judgment sheryl lee is luscious throughout, but her handling of the treacherous resi and her miserable crescendo almost makes you forget her beauty alan arkin constitutes a completely lovable, but equally treacherous, soviet spy br br don't feel you have to read mother night to appreciate the film though, if you haven't read mother night, you will probably want to after viewing the film br br notice the shifts from color to black and white and back again, and don't miss the final symbolism of campbell's noose watch, also, for kurt vonnegut's cameo near the end of the film br br bing crosby's white christmas will never sound the same (i write in mid december, when the song is getting heavy radio play, and it's driving me nuts)
