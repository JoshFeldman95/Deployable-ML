i really iove this show, it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more it gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode, and the struggle of effort to persist their friendship throughout the years after each episode ends it resigns a sweet soured taste in your throat knowing that one the show was good, you can't wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years and two the fact that the show has been put on hiatus and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety fox obviously don't know what they have done, they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 49 category they clearly don't know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as reunion i have one query though that i would like to raise if they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years \? your answers are most welcome bring back reunion ! bring back reunion !
