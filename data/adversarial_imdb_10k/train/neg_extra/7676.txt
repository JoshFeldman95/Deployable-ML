this is a adequate film for 99 of the duration i feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim br br it is shot in a rather naive fashion this is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique br br the gruesome characters are very allright acted and presented especiallythe'nutcase'called joe however, the wholesome (normal) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted, they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little ott br br the film starts slowly (and the naive camera work smacksof'b'movie to start with) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur this is one of themost'twisted'movies with respect to cold hearted violence br br after the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending i was left feeling disappointed i would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength ofthe'eeriness'and nail biting scenes earlier on in the film br br give it a watch and excuse the ending !
