this is an peachy movie as a canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle much of it is familiar, the winter, canoeing, trapping, hunting and the like it is easy to take the familiar for granted but after watching this film a few times it has grown on me br br the tales of gray owls is well known to many canadians credit to filmmaker attenborough and premise wrote nicholson for expanding the story br br brosnan wants adequately indicates a complex husband, a very fine performance annie galipeau is lovely in her first large role the rest of the cast is solid
