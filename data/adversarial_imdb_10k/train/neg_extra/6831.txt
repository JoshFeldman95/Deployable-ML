i saw this in the early 70s (when i was 16), and despite the long slow set up, meetings, riots, etc, once the desert section began all fell into context and i enjoying it (still do, it has aged very well) back then i was in what seemed to be a tiny minority all criticisms emerged to wears on the lack of action and narrative happilyi'm no longer in such a minority br br it deftly exemplifies (in a somewhat prophetic way) the political splintering, unrest, confrontation, brutal repression, commercialisation and deception which lay ahead br br appreciation for this magistral film has grown, andi'm glad about that
