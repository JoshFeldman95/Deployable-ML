strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their preferable movies i've seen br br a man who was hanged for a murder he didn't commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp, he disappears the old man's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married br br this movie has lots of foggy atmospheres, which makes it very creepy too ab brit the casting comprises rosemary las planche, brandon steadman and charl pippa (flashback gordo) as the strangler brit brit strangler of the marsh is a must for ancient spooky supporters like myself remarkable br ab ratings 3 and a medium star out of 5
