this movie has taken a lot of stick it was slated by critics when it came out and was blamed for shredding nicolas cage's career the thing i don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic, oscar contender of a movie, it's just some sumptuous bruck buster action at its best fast cars, quick editing and a admirable soundtrack it does exactly what it says on the tin also, for anyone who likes cars its a plain treatment it has everything ferraris, mercs, a hummer and lets not forget eleanor ! i think you'd be hard pushed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie at all ! ! then again maybe that's just me !
