i agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the ooohhh feeling you get at the end of this movie i absolutely loved the locations they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the trippy sounding track on which hans wilkie sings it's hallucinatory nighy was fob in his role, nail screwed it, beano was the typical drumming, and sra kept it together bruce robinson was awesome helena was a lovely girlfriend but i felt juliet aubrey's performance was gorgeous the scenes between aubrey robinson killed me ! satisfactorily walked and the music behind the scene was spots on ! too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out ! they ought to ! i've told all my musician friends great quote by jimmy nail's character it's supposed to be rock roll, not the phantom of the f g opera !
