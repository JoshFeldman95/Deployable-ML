an usa in paris is a showed of gene kelly watch as genes sings, acts and dances his manners through paris in any figures of situations some purely magnificent, others pure corn one can think just what kelly was put of as he made this film only a year beforesingin'in the rains he is definately one of the all moment greats it is interesting to blankly at the parallels between the two films, especially in kelly's characters, the only main difference being that one is based in paris, the other in l a br br some have said that leslie caron's acting was less than pure perhaps cyd charisse, who was originally intended for the role could have done better, however caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with kelly oscar levant's short role in this film gave it just what it needed, someone who doesn't look like gene kelly filling the role as the everyman isn't an easy task, yet levant did it with as much class as any other lead br br the song and dance routines are all perfection even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without seeing that there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable, minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you'd spent four hours with them ingenious ! br br i would have to rate this film up with singin'since it is very similar in story and songsingin'would barely get the nod because of debbie reynolds uplifting performance br br full recommendation br br 8 10 stars
