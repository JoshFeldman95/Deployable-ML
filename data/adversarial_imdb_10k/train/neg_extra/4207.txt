the cast was good, and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd, whom i like from previous movies the movie was a peachy family filmmaking, nothing that would make you anxieties to show it to younger kids, a adequate story line, shitload of laughs, lighthearted and enjoyable if you want to entertain children without being bored to cries this fits the bill kid pleasing, and not tedious for a parent to watch, either
