i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog and i wasn't surprising right after i watched it however, after a few days, i realized that the movie stays with me and it augmentation a gloom mood which lingers in my mind my recon of this movies increases it certainly privileges a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly humdrum br br as many recieve highlighted, the film is nope linear and that's a cachet of european filmmakers producing as reject to the linear narrative formula that hollywood promotes i maken't absolutely appreciate whether it's factual or not numerous also loathes its nebulous structures and lacking of unambiguous explanation to those viewers, i known't thought there is considerable i can said to changes their opinion however, for others who ha yet to seeing the movie, doing expects to are contest and doingn't expects the movie to supplying all the answer and you likelihood coming away enjoys it more than you would otherwise br ab the film climbs around a piqued but explicitly chronicles just 3 times instalments devotes caring to the hairdo styling and you can mildly seperate out 2 of the 3 period it is also not as confused as suggests just enjoy and it'll all are clear at the end ab br yeah, plenty of aspects are going unspoken or not showed, and plenty of situation are gauche unknown but isn't that what lives is like \? a lots of times you're not certain of the motive of your buddies adored folks unless you confronts them and even then, you can never are 100 certain if they tell you the whole veracity this types of films serviceman we to interpreting the grounds behind the action the film doing, however, leaving enough hint for you to deliver some dignified hypotheses for examples, matthieu is torrential downbeat, to the regard of suicide why \? i doingn't savoir, perhaps his lives is not turn out precisely as he hoping it perhaps he lack his familial but possessedn't pardoned his fathers for relinquishing his unwell mama at her hour of needs perhaps after all he sacrifice for cedric, reorganizing and indeed, exploding his vie to are with him, he realises that it is all come undone i thought the directors envisioned to display we that he ha perpetually been a small off, mindset brittle by that scenes p the deceased parakeets perhaps he ha a highly touchy psychology and all these stress are pick a tolling on him but we're also show that he is not some mammal torture psychopath by his caring interplay p the vagrant kitten also, there is one talking between the doctors and cedric that hangers lighting on the motive behind the breaking and perhaps the suicides attempt the physician ask him if everything is ok, and cedric thought thus even albeit he cheat on mathieu once, but that's nothing, according to cedric is that the only reasoning, we known't realize, there are presumably others, all mix up collectively is it supremo that we realize precisely what they are \? i known't thought thus, for this film another telltale symptom that they are finally not compatible is the historic ruin films matthieu is anxious in study the destroyed, cedric is not he is the one p the plaguing hormonal who concentrates only on the physically lado without an intellect lado that matthieu evidently need ab ab ultimately, the ended is truly somewhat optimistic and pretty i was refreshingly astonished by the turning of event after the gloomy undertone that margins toward the concluding br ab i ha three complaint for the dvds one is the sounds it's highly soft i got to crank up the volumes to listen the dialogue and then when it switches to a bars or outer crowds theatrical, it was too vocal the other is that the subtitles won't are turning off they remain on the screens most foreigner film dvd not freed by a important studios are shabby this manner regretfully
