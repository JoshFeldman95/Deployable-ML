sure this movie is not historically accurate but it is great entertainment most demille pictures especially the later epics are slow and plodding but the action here moves at a clip the story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments the actions takes us from an indian raid on a cabin one of the preferable aspects of the flick with jean arthur excellent while attempting to appease the war painted natives this is followed by her and cooper being opted to the war camp and being tortured later comes a protracted battle with the cheyenne the whole thing is ridiculous but sizeable fun and joke from start to finish jean arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here
