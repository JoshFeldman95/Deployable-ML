this movie hectare everything a fantasy movie envisaged get, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a unprejudiced intake of magic br br i thoroughly benefited this movie and was drawn to its original intrigue (based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read) and colorful characters br br one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is unlike so incalculable sci fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open endings and such this was a pure fairy fairytale, gratifying in and of itself with no vital for a sequel br br initial kidding feel good fantasy
