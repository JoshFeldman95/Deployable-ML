i just found the drugs annum on vh1 and i love it i think it represent the drug history very well and most very it had a stiff message to the all generations there is woodstock, there are joplin's, elvis's and jim morrison's deaths, there are many many examples of drug utilise and pharmacies abusing it completely include the chronology line and evolutionary of drugs use in america in both good and bad ways in my opinion this documentary is satisfactorily done and i would like to congratulate to its creators because this is exactly what is needed to be play in the tv in these days i am waiting for the dvd release you should definitely see it ! ! ! this movie is stunning big time !
