girlfight is using a well known formula as someone pointed out, however, i have seen plentiful of movie that don't do it this well or that are not this credible i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more knocked by the movie br br the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and, i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this although it took me 5 years to start fighter and sports in general, this is the film that dispensed me the inflames br br so the plot is familiar common actors are good but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion it made a big impression on me and i knowi'm not the only one
