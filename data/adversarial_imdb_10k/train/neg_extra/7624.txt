ultimatelyi'm biased to foxes, fox stories and all but i figured this was admirably done br br i really enjoyed that it was show when lily wasn't comfortable, such as the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here) i think that's important for kids to see and try to understand br br after reading a few others commentsi'm a bites confused, one says that at the end spoiler the mother and her son appear, as she's been the one telling her son about her story the movie i saw did not have the mother or son at the end, merely a painting of a girl with a fox can someone enlighten me on that \? anyway i really enjoyed this movie, although some scenes can be a bit slow which might be difficult for high energy kids to sit through still worth it if they can sit still
