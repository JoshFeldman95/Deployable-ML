after stared the trailers i was appalled this filming never brought it into filmmaking, so i declared the dvdrip i hectare a massive scheduling watching it and acres to argue that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there of course, it acres its faults but i can once really advise it the animation is well done, very jest and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end some of the backdrops are just drop dead gorgeous and you can see the french talent behind it i thought that rainforest whitaker's performance feels a bit dull but that is how the personage lian kikuchi is contained in this movie so overall, thumbs up, i liked it a lot and i hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this i would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are stitch like hilarious
