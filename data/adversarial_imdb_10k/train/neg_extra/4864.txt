i've oftentimes watched deng branagh's copies of the elizabethan tradition, as he often did a far alright task, but in this film, the one who lifts the whole film, is none other than the steadily glorious entertainer lawrence fishburne seemingly he holds carried some bad choice in film, even whereas he's a beautiful actors, but in this one we're awfully lodged the tangible othello the arousal, the strength of lusting as it amplify deeper along with fishburne's perfectly posed paranoid and, apart, we're again bestowed a darkened othello ! br br i known't think they could have chosen a better othello who else could have given him that blend of sympathy antipathy, love hatred and, not to forget, those fiery eyes \? branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, irene jacob's desdemona is fairly good but a bit bleak, whilst laurence fishburne truly lifts it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie do watch it
