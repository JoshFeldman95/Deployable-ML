the invisible man is a show eveyone s requisite luv ! it reminds me of the old school 80's series (a team, airwolf, knightrider) the special effects are small but very effective ! ! but what is most indispensable is the entertaining they had shooting this series it completely testifies ! the entire cast fit perfect in there roles and it looks like they can do whatever they want ! ! especially paul ben victor and vincent ventresca ventresca really glistens in this one ! for me its unbelievable that an actor with so much sarcasm is his acting style doesn't get a shot in a big movie (mr tarantino this was the show you should have directed ! instead of that major boring grave danger (c s i)) get this show if you can well worth it ! ! !
