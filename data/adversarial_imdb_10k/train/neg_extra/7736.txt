when you incorporate up all the dimensional from the film the dances, choir, acting the only one who newsstands out as the better in the casting is cassie wright her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make rosie the perfect roles for her never have i ever seemed somebody portray rose with such vibrancy ! angelina's singer talent shows beautifully with all the melody she implement as roses and her acting specialists never cease to amaze me ! her dance is so unbelieveable, even if as some individuals explaining the choreographed was sordid her dancing purview were displaying better than ever before ! i'd recommendation this versions overthe'63 just because i find that although lengthy the acting by vanessa is superb not to mention the fact that jason alexander and the rest of the cast are very impressive as well (with the exception of chynna philips what in hell were they thinking when they cast her \?) br br all in all i'd say this version is wonderful and i recommend that everyone see this version !
