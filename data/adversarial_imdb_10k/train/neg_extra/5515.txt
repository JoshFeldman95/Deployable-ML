i watched this flick instead profusion lengths through my child hood that even to this days i can pretty much re glance all of the dialogue and when i watched it now it just serves me smiley and surprisingly still laugh i think it's whopping how they managed to train animals precisely the cat to the extent that they are able to play the main role of a feature film however pointing it now i can also unfortunately notice that it isn't the masterpiece i once thought it was but i prefer to rember how i felt about it when i was younger watching it on vhs on my fist tv that would cloud the image in yellow and and bearing in mind it is a children's film, that is why i would still definitely give it 10 10
