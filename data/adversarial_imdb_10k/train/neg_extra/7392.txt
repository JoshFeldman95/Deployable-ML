first i would like to say how phenomenal this it is astounding and sometimes shocking and to say the leasti'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, i can definitely stand a monotonous film, but this is anything but boredom it is like a trekking through humanity its stark realism shows through this monumental mainstay it is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (voight and hoffman) who build a mutual friendship joe buck (voight) a naive texan stud comes to new york to make it rich by entertaining women soon he meetsrico'ratso'rizzo (hoffman), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent ratso becomes joe's'manager'but soon both men can't find joe a job which results in stealing food as they try and survive on the streets of new york we realize how tough it is they can't get joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party joe makes some money and soon joe takes ratso on a ratso's dream spot, florida the final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film from midnight cowboy we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life
