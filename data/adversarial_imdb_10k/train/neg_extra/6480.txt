i unimaginably advise this film set in the bladerunner esquire future of 2054 paris, it is in most conformity a classic film noir script lady in peril, sister trying to find her, honest cop fighting everyone luckily, it hampers being stereotypical, and combines a pretty adequate storyline with interesting, innovative visuals the film possibility remind you of sin city in look, but it has an even shinier, even more graphic novel look that i found really persuading each frame, each sequence seems like it could have been pulled from the desk of a skilled graphic designer in terms of story and artwork, you can find nods going back to the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the eiffel tower and sacre couer) and movies like casablanca, as well as looking toward a grim future where our destines are ruled by corporations make any excuse you need to see this film
