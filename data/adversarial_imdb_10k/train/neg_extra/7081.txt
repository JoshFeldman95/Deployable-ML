this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk the style of it was so divergent from others of its kind and the whole thing became an unnerving air of stylish dread to it all you be to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative that i can see) to fathom what a awfully innovate series this was and how it caught at the imagination i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable what a trousseauof'headless overpaid suitedturkeys'there must have been (or just maybe still are) running around to do that
