hmmm, yeah this episode is extremely underrated br br even besides there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts i think the good over wins the bad br br i love the origami parts and thebig'twist'at the end i absolutely worshipped that places when michelle confronts tony it's actually one of my prefered scenes of seasons 1 br br for some reason, populace had necessarily reviled the reincarnation episodes, yet i have ever likes them they're not the best, in terms of writing but the theme really could interesting me, br bri'm cant give it a three star, but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four
