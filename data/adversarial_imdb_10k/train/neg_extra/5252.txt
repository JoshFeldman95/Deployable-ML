my stepbrother and i obtains pokémon 4ever on bluray we watched it like a couple of hours and it was the best too bad it a new pokémon didn't talk this time i'll get used to it br br the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control br br there was only one song in the ending credits called cele b r a t e performed by russell espinosa br br pokemon 4ever became a succeeded since the four previous films and people will always luv that flick
